An Artist, Man Of The World, Man Of Crowds, And Child\nToday I want to talk to my readers about a singular man, whose originality is so powerful and clear-cut that it is self-sufficing, and does not bother to look for approval. None of his drawings is signed, if by signature we mean the few letters, which can be so easily forged, that compose a name, and that so many other artists grandly inscribe at the bottom of their most carefree sketches. But all his works are signed with his dazzling soul, and art-lovers who have seen and liked them will recognize them easily from the description I propose to give of them. M. C. G. loves mixing with the crowds loves being incognito, and carries his originality to the point of modesty. M. Thackeray, who, as is well known, is very interested in all things to do with art, and who draws the illustrations for his own novels, one day spoke of M. G. in a London review, much to the irritation of the latter who regarded the matter as an outrage to his modesty. And again quite recently, when he heard that I was proposing to make an assessment of his mind and talent, he begged me, in a most peremptory manner, to suppress his name, and to discuss his works only as though they were the works of some anonymous person. I will humbly obey this odd request. The reader and I will proceed as though M. G. did not exist, and we will discuss his drawings and his watercolors, for which he professes a patrician’s disdain, in the same way as would a group of scholars faced with the task of assessing the importance of a number of precious historical documents which chance has brought to light, and the author of which must for ever remain unknown. And even to reassure my conscience completely, let my readers assume that all the things I have to say about the artist’s nature, so strangely and mysteriously dazzling, have been more or less accurately suggested by the works in question; pure poetic hypothesis, conjecture, or imaginative reconstructions. M. G. is an old man. Jean-Jacques began writing, so they say, at the age of forty-two. Perhaps it was at about that age that M. G., obsessed by the world of images that filled his mind, plucked up courage to cast ink and colors on to a sheet of white paper. To be honest, he drew like a barbarian, like a child, angrily chiding his clumsy fingers and his disobedient tool. I have seen a large number of these early scribblings, and I admit that most of the people who know what they are talking about, or who claim to, could, without shame, have failed to discern the latent genius -2- that dwelt in these obscure beginnings. Today, M. G., who has discovered unaided all the little tricks of the trade, and who has taught himself, without help or advice, has become a powerful master in his own way; of his early artlessness he has retained only what was needed to add an unexpected spice to his abundant gift. When he happens upon one of these efforts of his early manner, he tears it up or burns it, with a most amusing show of shame and indignation. For ten whole years I wanted to make the acquaintance of M. G., who is by nature a great traveler and very cosmopolitan. I knew that he had for a long time been working for an English illustrated paper and that in it had appeared engravings from his travel sketches (Spain, Turkey, the Crimea). Since then I have seen a considerable mass of these on-the-spot drawings from life, and I have thus been able to ‘read’ a detailed and daily account, infinitely preferable to any other, of the Crimean campaign. The same paper had also published (without signature, as before) a large quantity of compositions by this artist from the new ballets and operas. When at last I ran him to ground I saw at once that I was not dealing exactly with an artist but rather with a man of the world. In this context, pray interpret the word ‘artist’ in a very narrow sense, and the expression ‘man of the world’ in a very broad one. By ‘man of the world’, I mean a man of the whole world, a man who understands the world and the mysterious and legitimate reasons behind all its customs; by ‘artist’, I mean a specialist, a man tied to his palette like a serf to the soil. M. G. does not like being called an artist. Is he not justified to a small extent? He takes an interest in everything the world over, he wants to know, understand, and assess everything that happens on the surface of our spheroid. The artist moves little, or even not at all, in intellectual and political circles. If he lives in the Breda quarter he knows nothing of what goes on in the Faubourg SaintGermain. With two or three exceptions, which it is unnecessary to name, the majority of artists are, let us face it, very skilled brutes, mere manual laborers, village pub-talkers with the minds of country bumpkins. Their talk; inevitably enclosed within very narrow limits, quickly becomes a bore to the man of the world, to the spiritual citizen of the universe. Thus to begin to understand M. G., the first thing to note is that curiosity may be considered the starting point of his genius. Do you remember a picture (for indeed it is a picture!) written by the most powerful pen of this age and entitled The Man of the Crowd? Sitting in a cafe, and looking through the shop window, a convalescent is enjoying the sight of the passing crowd, and identifying himself in thought with all the thoughts that are moving around him. He has only recently come back from the shades of -3- death and breathes in with delight all the spores and odors of life; as he has been on the point of forgetting everything, he remembers and passionately wants to remember everything. In the end he rushes out into the crowd in search of a man unknown to him whose face, which he had caught sight of, had in a flash fascinated him. Curiosity had become a compelling, irresistible passion. Now imagine an artist perpetually in the spiritual condition of the convalescent, and you will have the key to the character of M. G. But convalescence is like a return to childhood. The convalescent, like the child, enjoys to the highest degree the faculty of taking a lively interest in things, even the most trivial in appearance. Let us hark back, if we can, by a retrospective effort of our imaginations, to our youngest, our morning impressions, and we shall recognize that they were remarkably akin to the vividly colored impressions that we received later on after a physical illness, provided that illness left our spiritual faculties pure and unimpaired. The child sees everything as a novelty; the child is always ‘drunk’. Nothing is more like what we call inspiration than the joy the child feels in drinking in shape and color. I will venture to go even further and declare that inspiration has some connection with congestion, that every sublime thought is accompanied by a more or less vigorous nervous impulse that reverberates in the cerebral cortex. The man of genius has strong nerves; those of the child are weak. In the one, reason has assumed an important role; in the other, sensibility occupies almost the whole being. But genius is no more than childhood recaptured at will, childhood equipped now with man’s physical means to express itself, and with the analytical mind that enables it to bring order into the sum of experience, involuntarily amassed. To this deep and joyful curiosity must be attributed that stare, animal-like in its ecstasy, which all children have when confronted with something new, whatever it may be, face or landscape, light, gilding, colors, watered silk, enchantment of beauty, enhanced by the arts of dress. A friend of mine was telling me one day how, as a small boy, he used to be present when his father was dressing, and how he had always been filled with astonishment, mixed with delight, as he looked at the arm muscle, the color tones of the skin tinged with rose and yellow, and the bluish network of the veins. The picture of the external world was already beginning to fill him with respect, and to take possession of his brain. Already the shape of things obsessed and possessed him. A precocious fate was showing the tip of its nose. His damnation was settled. Need I say that, today, the child is a famous painter. -4- I was asking you just now to think of M. G. as an eternal convalescent; to complete your idea of him, think of him also as a man-child, as a man possessing at every moment the genius of childhood, in other words a genius for whom no edge of life is blunted. I told you that I was unwilling to call him a pure artist, and that he himself rejected this title, with a modesty tinged with aristocratic restraint. I would willingly call him a dandy, and for that I would have a sheaf of good reasons; for the word ‘dandy’ implies a quintessence of character and a subtle under-standing of all the moral mechanisms of this world; but, from another aspect, the dandy aspires to cold detachment, and it is in this way that M. G, who is dominated, if ever anyone was, by an insatiable passion, that of seeing and feeling, parts company trenchantly with dandyism. Anabam amare, said St Augustine. ‘I love passion, passionately,’ M. G. might willingly echo. The dandy is blasé, or affects to be, as a matter of policy and class attitude. M. G. hates blasé people. Sophisticated minds will understand me when I say that he possesses that difficult art of being sincere without being ridiculous. I would confer on him the title of philosopher, to which he has a right for more than one reason; but his excessive love of visible, tangible things, in their most plastic form, inspires him with a certain dislike of those things that go to make up the intangible kingdom of the metaphysical. Let us therefore reduce him to the status of the pure pictorial moralist, like La Bruyere. The crowd is his domain, just as the air is the bird’s, and water that of the fish. His passion and his profession is to merge with the crowd. For the perfect idler, for the passionate ob-server it becomes an immense source of enjoyment to establish his dwelling in the throng, in the ebb and flow, the bustle, the fleeting and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel at home anywhere; to see the world, to be at the very centre of the world, and yet to be unseen of the world, such are some of the minor pleasures of those independent, intense and impartial spirits, who do not lend themselves easily to linguistic definitions. The observer is a prince enjoying his incognito wherever he goes. The lover of life makes the whole world into his family, just as the lover of the fair sex creates his from all the lovely women he has found, from those that could be found, and those who arc impossible to find, just as the picture-lover lives in an enchanted world of dreams painted on canvas. Thus the lover of universal life moves into the crowd as though into an enormous reservoir of electricity. He, the lover of life, may also be compared to a mirror as vast as this crowd: to a kaleidoscope endowed with consciousness, which with every one of its movements presents a pattern of life, in all its multiplicity, and the flowing grace of all the -5- elements that go to compose life. It is an ego athirst for the non-ego, and reflecting it at every moment in energies more vivid than life itself, always inconstant and fleeting. ‘Any man’, M. G. once said, in one of those talks he rendered memorable by the intensity of his gaze, and by his eloquence of gesture, ‘any man who is not weighed down with a sorrow so searching as to touch all his faculties, and who is bored in the midst of the crowd, is a fool! A fool! and I despise him!’ When, as he wakes up, M. G. opens his eyes and sees the beating vibrantly at his window-panes, he says to himself with remorse and regret: ‘What an imperative command! What a fanfare of light! Light everywhere for several hours past! Light I have lost in sleep! and endless numbers of things bathed in light that I could have seen and have failed to!’ And off he goes! And he watches the flow of life move by, majestic and dazzling. He admires the eternal beauty and the astonishing harmony of life in the capital cities, a harmony so providentially maintained in the tumult of human liberty. He gazes at the landscape of the great city, landscapes of stone, now swathed in the mist, now struck in full face by the sun. He enjoys handsome equipages, proud horses, the spit and polish of the grooms, the skilful handling by the page boys, the smooth rhythmical gait of the women, the beauty of the children, full of the joy of life and proud as peacocks of their pretty clothes; in short, life universal. If in a shift of fashion, the cut of a dress has been slightly modified, if clusters of ribbons and curls have been dethroned by rosettes, if bonnets have widened and chignons have come down a little on the nape of the neck, if waistlines have been raised and skirts become fuller, you may be sure that from a long way off his eagle’s eye will have detected it. A regiment marches by, maybe on its way to the ends of the earth, filling the air of the boulevard with its martial airs, as light and lively as hope; and sure enough M. G. has already seen, inspected and analyzed the weapons and the bearing of this whole body of troops. Harness, highlights, bands, determined mien, heavy and grim mustachios, all these details flood chaotically into him; and within a few minutes the poem that comes with it all is virtually composed. And then his soul will vibrate with the soul of the regiment, marching as though it were one living creature, proud image of joy and discipline! But evening comes. The witching hour, the uncertain light, when the sky draws its curtains and the city lights go on. The gaslight stands out on the purple background of the setting sun. Honest men or crooked customers, wise or irresponsible, all are saying to themselves: ‘The day is clone at last!’ Good men and bad turn their thoughts to pleasure, and each hurries to his favorite haunt to drink the cup of oblivion. M G. will be the last to leave any place where the departing glories -6- of daylight linger, where poetry echoes, life pulsates, music sounds; any place where a human passion offers a subject to his eye where natural man and conventional man reveal themselves in strange beauty, where the rays of the dying sun pay on the fleeting pleasure of the ‘depraved animal!’ ‘Well, there, to be sure, is a day well filled,’ murmurs to himself a type of reader wellknown to all of us; ‘each one of us has surely enough genius to fill it in the same way.’ No! few men have the gift of seeing; fewer still have the power to express themselves. And now, whilst others are sleeping, this man is leaning over his table, his steady gaze on a sheet of paper, exactly the same gaze as he directed just now at the things about him, brandishing his pencil, his pen, his brush, splashing water from the glass up to the ceiling, wiping his pen on his shirt, hurried, vigorous, active, as though he was afraid the images might escape him, quarrelsome though alone, and driving himself relentlessly on. And things seen are born again on the paper, natural and more than natural, beautiful and better than beautiful, strange and endowed with an enthusiastic life, like the soul of their creator. The weird pageant has been distilled from nature. All the materials, stored higgledy-piggledy by memory, are classified, ordered, harmonized, and undergo that deliberate idealization, which is the product of a childlike perceptiveness, in other words a perceptiveness that is acute and magical by its very ingenuousness. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nIV. MODERNITY \n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nAnd so, walking or quickening his pace, he goes his way, for ever in search. In search of what? We may rest assured that this man, such as I have described him, this solitary mortal endowed with an active imagination, always roaming the great desert of men, has a nobler aim than that of the pure idler, a more general aim, other than the fleeting pleasure of circumstance. He is looking for that indefinable something we may be allowed to call ‘modernity’, for want of a better term to express the idea in question. The aim for him is to extract from fashion the poetry that resides in its historical envelope, to distil the eternal from the transitory. If we cast our eye over our exhibitions of modern pictures, we shall be struck by the general tendency of our artists to clothe all manner of subjects in the dress of the past. Almost all of them use the fashions and the furnishings of the Renaissance, as David used Roman fashions and furnishings, but there is this difference, that David, having chosen subjects peculiarly Greek or Roman, could not do otherwise than present them in the style of antiquity, whereas the painters of today, choosing, as -7- they do, subjects of a general nature, applicable to all ages, will insist on dressing them up in the fashion of the Middle Ages, of the Renaissance, or of the East. This is evidently sheer laziness; for it is much more convenient to state roundly that everything is hopelessly ugly in the dress of a period than to apply oneself to the task of extracting the mysterious beauty that may be hidden there, however small or light it may be. Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent; it is one half of art, the other being the—eternal and the immovable. There was a form of modernity for every painter of the past; the majority of the fine portraits that remain to us from former times arc clothed in the dress of their own day. They are perfectly harmonious works because the dress, the hairstyle, and even the gesture, the expression and the smile (each age has its carriage, its expression and its smile) form a whole, full of vitality. You have no right to despise this transitory fleeting element, the metamorphoses of which arc so frequent, nor to dispense with it. If you do, you inevitably fall into the emptiness of an abstract and indefinable beauty, like that of the One and only woman of the time before the Fall. If for the dress of the day, which is necessarily right, you substitute another, you are guilty of a piece of nonsense that only a fancy-dress ball imposed by fashion can excuse. Thus the goddesses, the nymphs, and sultanas of the eighteenth century are portraits in the spirit of their day. No doubt it is an excellent discipline to study the old masters, in order to learn how to paint, but it can be no more than a superfluous exercise if your aim is to understand the beauty of the present day. The draperies of Rubens or Veronese will not teach you how to paint watered silk d [‘antique, or satin a la reine, or any other fabric produced by our mills, supported by a swaying crinoline, or petticoats of starched muslin. The texture and grain are not the same as in the fabrics of old Venice, or those worn at the court of Catherine. We may add that the cut of the skirt and bodice is absolutely different, that the pleats are arranged into a new pattern, and finally that the gesture and carriage of the woman of today give her dress a vitality and a character that are not those of the woman of former ages. In short, in order that any form of modernity may be worthy of becoming antiquity, the mysterious beauty that human life unintentionally puts into it must have been extracted from it. It is this task that M. G. particularly addresses himself to. I have said that every age has its own carriage, its expression, its gestures. This proposition may be easily verified in a large portrait gallery (the one at Versailles, for example). But it can be yet further extended. In a unity we call a nation, the professions, the social classes, the successive centuries, introduce variety not only in gestures and manners, but also in the general outlines of -8- faces. Such and such a nose, mouth, forehead, will be standard for a given interval of time, the length of which I shall not claim to determine here, but which may certainly be a matter of calculation. Such ideas are not familiar enough to portrait painters; and the great weakness of M. Ingres, in particular, is the desire to impose on every type that sits for him a more or less complete process of improvement, in other words a despotic perfecting process, borrowed from the store of classical ideas. In a matter such as this, a priori reasoning would be easy and even legitimate. The perpetual correlation between what is called the soul and what is called the body is a quite satisfactory explanation of how what is material or emanates from the spiritual reflects and will always reflect the spiritual force it derives from. If a painter, patient and scrupulous but with only inferior imaginative power, were commissioned to paint a courtesan of today, and, for this purpose, were to get his inspiration (to use the hallowed term) from a courtesan by Titian or Raphael, the odds are that his work would be fraudulent, ambiguous, and difficult to understand. The study of a masterpiece of that date and of that kind will not teach him the carriage, the gaze, the come-hitherishness, or the living representation of one of these creatures that the dictionary of fashion has, in rapid succession, pigeonholed under the coarse or light-hearted rubric of unchaste, kept women, Lorettes. The same remark applies precisely to the study of the soldier, the dandy, and even animals, dogs or horses, and of all things that go to make up the external life of an age. Woe betide the man who goes to antiquity for the study of anything other than ideal art, logic and general method! By immersing, himself too deeply in it, he will no longer have the present in his mind’s eye; he throws away the value and the privileges afforded by circumstance; for nearly all our originality comes from the stamp that it impresses upon our sensibility. The reader will readily understand that I could easily verify my assertions from innumerable objects other than women. What would you say, for example, of a marine painter (I take an extreme case) who, having to represent the sober and elegant beauty of a modern vessel, were to tire out his eyes in the study of the overloaded, twisted shapes, the monumental stern, of ships of bygone ages, and the complex sails and rigging of the sixteenth century? And what would you think of an artist you had commissioned to do the portrait of a thorough-bred, celebrated in the solemn annals of the turf, if he were to restrict his studies to museums, if he were to content himself with looking at equine studies of the past in the picture galleries, in Van Dyck, Bourguignon, or Van der Meulen? -9- M.G., guided by nature, tyrannized over by circumstance, has followed a quite different path. He began by looking at life, and only later did he contrive to learn how to express life. The result has been a striking originality, in which whatever traces of untutored simplicity may still remain take on the appearance of an additional proof of obedience to the impression, of a flattery of truth. For most of us, especially for businessmen, in whose eyes nature does not exist, unless it be in its strict utility relationship with their business interests, the fantastic reality of life becomes strangely blunted. M.G. registers it constantly; his memory and his eyes are full of it. .......... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nIX. THE DANDY \n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nThe wealthy man, who, blasé though he may be, has no occupation in life but to chase along the highway of happiness, the man nurtured in luxury, and habituated from early youth to being obeyed by others, the man, finally, who has no profession other than elegance, is bound at all times to have a facial expression of a very special kind. Dandyism is an ill-defined social attitude as strange as dueling; it goes back a long way, since Caesar, Catilina, Alcibiades provide us with brilliant examples of it; it is very widespread, since Chateaubriand found examples of it in the forests and on the lake-sides of the New World. Dandyism, which is an institution outside the law, has a rigorous code of laws that all its subjects are strictly bound by, however ardent and independent their individual characters may be. The English novelists, more than others, have cultivated the ‘high life’ type of novel, and their French counterparts who, like M. de Custine, have tried to specialize in love novels have very wisely taken care to endow their characters with purses long enough for them to indulge without hesitation their slightest whims; and they freed them from any profession. These beings have no other status but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and thinking. Thus-they possess, to their hearts’ content, and to a vast degree,. both time and money, without which fantasy, reduced to the state of ephemeral reverie, can scarcely be translated into action. It is unfortunately very true that, without leisure and money, love can be no more than an orgy of the common man, or the accomplishment of a conjugal duty. Instead of being a sudden’ impulse full of ardor and reverie, it becomes a distastefully utilitarian affair. -10- If I speak of love in the context of dandyism, the reason is that love is the natural occupation of men of leisure. But the dandy does not consider love as a special aim in life. If I have mentioned money, the reason is that money is indispensable to those who make an exclusive cult of their passions, but the dandy does not aspire to wealth as an object in itself; an open bank credit could suit him just as well; he leaves that squalid passion to vulgar mortals. Contrary to what a lot of thoughtless people seem to believe, dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance. For the perfect dandy, these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of his mind. Thus, in his eyes, enamored as he is above all of distinction, perfection in dress consists in absolute simplicity, which is, indeed, the best way of being distinguished. What then can this passion be, which has crystallized into a doctrine, and has formed a number of outstanding devotees, this unwritten code that has molded so proud a brotherhood? It is, above all, the burning desire to create a personal form of originality, within the external limits of social conventions. It is a kind of cult of the ego which can still survive the pursuit of that form of happiness to be found in others, in woman for example; which can even survive what are called illusions. It is the pleasure of causing surprise in others, and the proud satisfaction of never showing any oneself. A dandy may be blasé, he may even suffer pain, but in the latter case he will keep smiling, like the Spartan under the bite of the fox. Clearly, then, dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to stoicism, but a dandy can never be a vulgar man. If he were to commit a crime, he might perhaps be socially damned, but if the crime came from some trivial cause, the disgrace would be irreparable. Let the reader not be shocked by this mixture of the grave and the gay; let him rather reflect that there is a sort of grandeur in all follies, a driving power in every sort of excess. A strange form of spirituality indeed! For those who are its high priests and its victims at one and the same time, all the complicated material conditions they subject themselves to, from the most flawless dress at any time of day or night to the most risky sporting feats, are no more than a series of gymnastic exercises suitable to strengthen the will and school the soul. Indeed I was not far wrong when I compared dandyism to a kind of religion. The most rigorous monastic rule, the inexorable commands of the Old Man of the Mountain, who enjoined suicide on his intoxicated disciples, were not more despotic or more slavishly obeyed than this doctrine of elegance and originality, which, like the others, imposes upon its ambitious and humble sectaries, men as often as not full of spirit, passion, courage, controlled energy, the terrible precept: Perinde ac cadaver! -11- Fastidious, unbelievables, beaux, lions or dandies: which ever label these men claim for themselves, one and all stem from the same origin, all share the same characteristic of opposition and revolt; all are representatives of what is best in human pride, of that need, which is too rare in the modern generation, to combat and destroy triviality. That is the source, in your day, of that haughty, patrician attitude, aggressive even in its coldness. Dandyism appears especially in those periods of transition when democracy has not yet become all-powerful, and when aristocracy is only partially weakened and discredited. In the confusion of such times, a certain number of men, disenchanted and leisured ‘outsiders’, but all of them richly endowed with native energy, may conceive the idea of establishing a new kind of aristocracy, all the more difficult to break down because established on the most precious, the most indestructible faculties, on the divine gifts that neither work nor money can give. Dandyism is the last flicker of heroism in decadent ages; and the sort of dandy discovered by the traveler in Northern America in no sense invalidates this idea; for there is no valid reason why we should not believe that the tribes we call savage are not the remnants of great civilizations of the past. Dandyism is a setting sun; like the declining star, it is magnificent, without heat and full of melancholy. But alas! the rising tide of democracy, which spreads everywhere and reduces everything to the same level, is daily carrying away these last champions of human pride, and submerging, in the waters of oblivion, the last traces of these remarkable myrmidons. Here in France, dandies are be-coming rarer and rarer, whereas amongst our neighbors in England the state of society and the constitution (the true constitution, the one that is expressed in social habits) will, for a long time yet, leave room for the heirs of Sheridan, Brummell and Byron, always assuming that men worthy of them come forward. What to the reader may have seemed a digression is not one in fact. The moral reflections and musings that arise from the drawings of an artist are in many cases the best interpretation that the critic can make of them; the notions they suggest are part of an underlying idea, and, by revealing them in turn, we may uncover the root idea itself. Need I say that when M.G. commits one of his dandies to paper, he always gives him his historical character, we might almost say his legendary character, were it not that we are dealing with our own day and with things that are generally held to be light-hearted? For here we surely have that ease of bearing, that sureness of manner, that simplicity in the habit of command, that way of wearing a frock-coat or controlling a horse, that calmness revealing strength in every circumstance, that convince us, when our eye -12- does pick out one of those privileged beings, in whom the attractive and the formidable mingle so mysteriously: ‘There goes a rich man perhaps, but quite certainly an unemployed Hercules.’ The specific beauty of the dandy consists particularly in that cold exterior resulting from the unshakeable determination to remain unmoved; one is reminded of a latent fire, whose existence is merely suspected, and which, if it wanted to, but it does not, could burst forth in all its brightness. All that is expressed to perfection in these illustrations."}]}

And  photographers alone manufacture the reproduction of nature.  \n* * *  \nPurity and unity do not count without the truth which cannot  be compared to reality since it is the same, outside of all the  natures which strive to keep us in the fatal order where we  are only animals.  \n* * *  \nAbove all, artists are men who want to become inhuman.  \nThey search painfully for traces of inhumanity, traces that are  found nowhere in nature.  \nThey are the truth and outside of them we know no  reality.  \n* * *  \nBut, reality will never be discovered once and for all. The  truth will always be new.  \nOtherwise, it is only a system more miserable than nature.  \nIn that case, the deplorable truth, more distant, less distinct,less less  real every day would reduce painting to the state of plastic writin  simply intended to facilitate relations between people of the same  race  \nNowadays, one would quickly find the machine to reproduce such  signs, without understanding.  \n\n\nII  \n\nMany new painters only paint pictures where there is  no real subject. And the denominations that one finds in the  catalogs then play the role of names that designate men without  characterizing them.  \nJust as there are Legros who are very thin and Leblonds  who are very dark, I have seen canvases called: _Solitude_, where there  were several figures.  \nIn the cases in question, one still sometimes condescends to use  vaguely explanatory words like _portrait, landscape, still life_;  but many young artist-painters only use the  general term of _painting._  \nThese painters, if they still observe nature, no longer imitate it and  they carefully avoid the representation of natural scenes observed  and reconstituted by study.  \nVerisimilitude no longer has any importance, because everything is sacrificed by  the artist to the truths, to the necessities of a higher nature that he  supposes without discovering it. The subject no longer counts, or if it does, it is  barely.  \nModern art generally rejects most of the means of pleasing  implemented by the great artists of times past.  \nIf the goal of painting is still as it once was: the pleasure  of the eyes, the amateur is now asked to find in it a pleasure other  than that which can be procured by the spectacle of  natural things.  \n* * *  \nWe are thus moving towards an entirely new art, which will be to  painting, as it has been envisaged until now, what music  is to literature.  \nIt will be pure painting, just as music is  pure literature.  \nThe music lover experiences, when hearing a concert, a joy of a  different order from the joy he experiences when listening to natural sounds  such as the murmur of a stream, the roar of a torrent, the  whistling of the wind in a forest, or the harmonies of human language  based on reason and not on aesthetics.  \nSimilarly, new painters will give their admirers  artistic sensations due solely to the harmony of odd lights  .  \n* * *  \nWe know the anecdote of Apelles and Protogenes which is in Pliny.  \nIt clearly shows the aesthetic pleasure resulting only fro  this odd construction of which I spoke.  \nApelles approaches, one day,in the island of Rhodes to see the works of  Protogenes, who lived there. He was absent from his studio when  Apelles went there. An old woman was there who kept a large picture  all ready to be painted. Apelles, instead of leaving his name, drew on the  picture a line so delicate that nothing better could be seen.  \nOn his return, Protogenes, seeing the lineament, recognized Apelles' hand  , and drew on the line a line of another color and  even more subtle, and, in this way, it seemed that there were three lines.  \nApelles returned again the next day without finding the one he was looking for  and the subtlety of the line he drew that day drove Protogenes to despair.  This picture long aroused the admiration of connoisseurs who  looked at it with as much pleasure as if, instead of representing  almost invisible lines, gods and goddesses had been depicted on it.  \n* * *  \nThe young painters of the extreme schools have the secret goal of  creating pure painting. This is an entirely new plastic art.  It is only in its infancy and is not yet as abstract  as it would like to be. Most of the new painters do indeed practice  mathematics without knowing it, but they have not yet abandoned  nature, which they patiently question so that it  may teach them the path of life.  \nA Picasso studies an object as a surgeon dissects a corpse.  \nThis art of pure painting, if it succeeds in freeing itself entirely from  the old painting, will not necessarily cause its disappearance  , any more than the development of music caused the  disappearance of the different literary genres, any more than the acridity of  tobacco replaced the flavor of food.  \n\n\nIII  \n\nThe new painters have been strongly criticized for their  geometric preoccupations. However, geometric figures  are the essence of drawing. Geometry, the science whose object  is extension, its measurement and its relationships, has always been the very rule  of painting.  \nUntil now, the three dimensions of Euclidean geometry  were sufficient for the anxieties that the feeling of infinity puts in the souls  of great artists.  \nThe new painters, no more than their elders, have proposed  to be geometers. But one can say that geometry is to the  plastic arts what grammar is to the art of the writer. Now,  today,scientists no longer stick to three dimension  of Euclidean geometry. Painters were brought all  naturally and,so to speak, by intuition, to worr  new possible measures of extent that in the language of  modern studios were designated all together and briefly by the  term _fourth dimension._  \n* * *  \nAs it presents itself to the mind, from the plastic point of view, the  fourth dimension would be engendered by the three known measures:  it represents the immensity of space stretching out in all  directions at a given moment. It is space itself, the dimension  of infinity; it is this which endows objects with plasticity. It  gives them the proportions they deserve in the work, while in  Greek art for example, a rhythm that is in some way mechanical  constantly destroys the proportions.  \nGreek art had a purely human conception of beauty. It  took man as the measure of perfection. The art of the  new painters takes the infinite universe as an ideal and it is to this ideal  that we owe a new measure of perfection which allows  the artist-painter to give the object proportions in accordance with the  degree of plasticity to which he wishes to bring it.  \nNietzsche had divined the possibility of such an art:  \n    ''O divine Dionysius, why are you pulling my ears?''      Ariadne asks her philosophical lover in one of his      famous dialogues on the Island of Naxos. ''I find something      agreeable, pleasing in your ears, Ariadne:      why are they not even longer?'' Nietzsche, when he relates this anecdote, makes  a trial of Greek art  \nthrough the mouth of Dionysius.  Let us add that this imagination: _the fourth dimension_, was only  the manifestation of the aspirations, the worries of a large number  of young artists looking at Egyptian, Negro and Oceanian sculptures  , meditating on works of science, waiting for a  sublime art, and, that today we no longer attach to this  utopian expression, which had to be noted and explained, anything but a  sort of historical interest.  IV  Wanting to reach the proportions of the ideal, not limiting themselves to  humanity, young painters offer us works that are more cerebral  than sensual. They move further and further away from the old art of  optical illusions and local proportions to express the  grandeur of metaphysical forms. This is why current art,if  it is not the direct emanation of specific religious beliefs  \n\n\nHowever, it presents several characteristics of great art, that is to say, of  religious art.  \n\n\nV\n\nwere made with a feeling similar to  that of Renoir when he painted his portraits? No one then thought about i  \n  The great poets and great artists have the social function o  to constantly renew the appearance that nature takes on in the eyes of  men.  \nWithout poets, without artists, men would quickly become bored with  natural monotony. The sublime idea they have of the universe would fall away  with dizzying speed. The order that appears in nature and which  is only an effect of art would vanish at once. Everything would fall apart  in chaos. No more seasons, no more civilization, no more thought,  no more humanity, no more life even, and impotent darkness would reign  forever.  \nPoets and artists determine together the figure of their  era and docilely the future falls in line with their opinion.  \nThe general structure of an Egyptian mummy conforms to the figures  traced by Egyptian artists and yet the ancient Egyptians  were very different from one another. They conformed to  the art of their era.  \nIt is the nature of Art, its social role, to create this illusion: the  type. God knows that the paintings of Manet and Renoir have been mocked!  Well! It is enough to cast one's eyes over photographs of the period  to see the conformity of people and things to the pictures  that these great painters painted of them.  \nThis illusion seems completely natural to me, works of art being  the most energetic thing an era produces from a  plastic point of view. This energy imposes itself on men and is for them the  plastic measure of an era. Thus, those who mock the new  painters are mocking their own figure, because the humanity of the future  will represent the humanity of today according to the representations  that the artists of the most living art, that is to say the most  recent, will have left of it. Do not tell me that there are  other painters today who paint in such a way that humanity can  recognize itself painted in its image. All works of art of an  era end up resembling the works of the most energetic,  the most expressive, the most typical art. Dolls come from a  popular art; they always seem inspired by the works of the great  art of the same era. This is a truth that is easy to verify.  And yet who would dare to say that the dolls sold in  bazaars around 1880 were made with a feeling similar to what  he perceived. This means, however, that Renoir's art was quite  energetic,lively enough to impose itself on our senses while to the general  public of the time when he started, his conceptions appeared as  as much a collection of absurdities and follies.  \n\n\nVI  \n\nWe have sometimes, and especially with regard to the most recent painters  , considered the possibility of a collective mystification or error  .  \nNow, we do not know of a single collective mystification in the entire history of art  , nor a single collective artistic error.  There are isolated cases of mystification and error, but the  conventional elements of which works of art are largely composed  guarantee us that of these cases there could be no collective ones.  \nIf the new school of painting presented us with one of these cases, it  would be such an extraordinary event that we could call it a  miracle. To conceive of a case of this sort would be to conceive that  suddenly, in a nation, all the children would be born without a  head or a leg or an arm, an obviously absurd conception. There  are no collective errors or mystifications in art, there are only  different eras and different schools of art. If the goal pursued  by each of them is not equally high, equally pure, all are  equally respectable, and, according to one's ideas of beauty  , each artistic school is successively admired, despised and  admired again.  \n\n\nVII  \n\nThe new school of painting bears the name of Cubism; it was given to it  in derision in the autumn of 1908 by Henri Matisse who had just seen a  painting representing houses whose cubic appearance struck him  deeply.  \nThis new aesthetic was first developed in the mind of André  Derain, but the most important and most audacious works  that it immediately produced were those of a great artist who  must also be considered a founder: Pablo Picasso, whose  inventions, corroborated by the common sense of Georges Braque, who exhibited  a Cubist painting at the Salon des Indépendants in 1908, were  formulated in the studies of Jean Metzinger, who exhibited the first  Cubist portrait (it was mine) at the Salon des Indépendants in 1910 and  also had Cubist works admitted by the jury of the Salon d'Automne that same year . It was also in 1910  that paintings by Robert Delaunay, Marie Laurencin, and Le Fauconnier,  which belonged to the same school,  appeared at the Indépendants   The first general exhibition of Cubism, whose followers  were becoming more numerous, took place in 1911 at the Indépendants, where th    Room 41, reserved for Cubists, made a deep impression.There  were scholarly and attractive works by Jean Metzinger  landscapes, the _Naked Man and the Woman with Phlox_ by Albert Gleizes; the  _Portrait of Mrs. Fernande X..._ and the _Young Girls_ by Miss  Marie Laurencin, the _Tower_ by Robert Delaunay, the _Abundance_ by Le  Fauconnier, the _Nudes in a Landscape_ by Fernand Léger.  \nThe first manifestation of the Cubists abroad took place in  Brussels, the same year and in the preface of this exhibition  I accepted, on behalf of the exhibitors, the names: _Cubism_ and  _Cubists._  \nAt the end of 1911, the exhibition of the Cubists at the Salon d'Automne made a  considerable noise, the mockery was not spared neither Gleizes  (_The Hunt, Portrait of Jacques Nayral_), nor Metzinger (_The Woman  with a Spoon_), nor Fernand Léger. These artists were joined by  a new painter, Marcel Duchamp, and a sculptor-architect,  Duchamp-Villon.  \nOther group exhibitions took place in November 1911 at the  Galerie d'Art Contemporain, rue Tronchet, in Paris; in 1912, at the Salon  des Indépendants, which was marked by the adhesion of Juan Gris; in May  , in Spain, where Barcelona enthusiastically welcomed the young  French; finally, in June, in Rouen, an exhibition organized by the  Society of Norman Artists, which was marked by the adhesion of  Francis Picabia to the new School. (_Note written in September 1912._)  \n* * *  \nWhat differentiates Cubism from the old painting is that it is  not an art of imitation, but an art of conception which tends to rise  to creation.  \nBy representing conceived-reality or created-reality, the painter  can give the appearance of three dimensions, can in a way  _cubicize._ He could not do this by simply rendering seen-reality,  unless he were to create trompe-l'oeil in foreshortening or perspective, which  would distort the quality of the conceived or created form.  \nFour tendencies have now manifested themselves in Cubism as  I have quartered it. Two of them are parallel and pure.  \n_Scientific Cubism_ is one of these pure tendencies. It is the art  of painting new wholes with elements borrowed, not from the  reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge.  \nEvery man has a feeling for this inner reality. There is no  need to be a cultivated man to conceive, for example, a  round form    The geometric aspect which so vividly struck those who saw th  The first scientific paintings came from the fact that essential reality  was rendered with great purity and that visual and  anecdotal accidents had been eliminated.  \nThe painters who belong to this art are: Picasso, whose luminous art  still belongs to the other pure tendency of Cubism, Georges  Braque, Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Mlle Laurencin and Juan Gris.  \n_Physical Cubism_, which is the art of painting new ensembles  with elements borrowed for the most part from visual reality. This  art, however, belongs to Cubism by constructive discipline. It  has a great future as history painting. Its social role is well  marked, but it is not a pure art. It confuses the subject with the  images.  \nThe physical painter who created this tendency is Le Fauconnier.  \n_Orphic Cubism_ is the other great tendency of modern painting  . It is the art of painting new ensembles with  elements borrowed not from visual reality, but entirely created  by the artist and endowed by him with a powerful reality. The works  of Orphic artists must simultaneously present a  pure aesthetic pleasure, a construction that falls under the senses and a  sublime meaning, that is to say, the subject. It is pure art. The  light of Picasso's works contains this art that  Robert Delaunay invented for his part and in which Fernand Léger, Francis Picabia  and Marcel Duchamp also strived.  \nInstinctive Cubism, the art of painting new ensembles  borrowed not from visual reality, but from that which  instinct and intuition suggest to the artist, has long tended towards  Orphism. Instinctive artists lack lucidity and  artistic belief; instinctive Cubism includes a very large  number of artists. Originating from French Impressionism, this movement  now extends throughout Europe.  \n* * *  \nCézanne's last paintings and his watercolors belong to  Cubism, but Courbet is the father of the new painters and André  Derain, to whom I will return one day, was the eldest of his  beloved sons, because we find him at the origin of the Fauve movement which  was a sort of preamble to Cubism and still at the origin of this great  subjective movement, but it would be too difficult today to  write well about a man who voluntarily keeps himself apart from everything  and everyone  \n* * *  \nThe modern school of painting seems to me the most daring that has eve  summer. She posed the question of beauty in itself.  \nShe wants to imagine beauty freed from the delight of man,  causes in man, and since the beginning of historical times no  European artist had dared to do this.New artists need   ideal beauty, which is no longer just the proud expression of  the species, but the expression of the universe, to the extent that it has become  humanized in the light.  \n* * *  \nToday's art clothes its creations with a grandiose,  monumental appearance, which in this respect surpasses anything conceived  by the artists of our age. Ardent in the search for beauty,  it is noble, energetic, and the reality it brings us is  marvelously clear.  \nI love today's art because I love light above all else, and  all men love light above all else; they invented fire.  \n\n\n\nNew Painters  \n\n\nPICASSO  \n\nIf we knew, all the gods would awaken. Born from the  profound knowledge that humanity retained of itself, the adored pantheisms  that resembled it have fallen asleep. But despite eternal sleep  , there are eyes that reflect humanities like  divine and joyful ghosts.  \nThese eyes are attentive like flowers that always want  to contemplate the sun. O fertile joy, there are men who see with  these eyes.  \n* * *  \nAt that time, Picasso had looked at human images that  floated in the azure of our memories and that participate in  divinity to damn the metaphysicians. How pious are his skies  all stirred by flights, his lights heavy and low like those  of caves.  \nThere are children who have wandered without learning the catechism. They  stop and the rain stops falling: ''Look! People in these  buildings and their clothes are poor.'' These children whom we do not kiss  understand so much! Mother, love me well! They know how to jump and the  tricks they succeed in are mental evolutions.  \nThese women whom we no longer love remember. They have spent too much time  today ruminating over their brittle ideas. They do not pray; they are  devoted to memories. They huddle in the twilight  like an ancient church. These women renounce and their fingers  would move to weave straw wreaths. With the day, they  disappear, they have consoled themselves in silence. They have  passed through many doors:Mothers protected the cradles so  that the newborns would not be badly gifted; when they bent over,  the little children smiled to know they were so good  \nThey have often given thanks and the gestures of their forearms  trembled like their eyelids  \n. Enveloped in icy mist, old men wait without meditating, for only children meditate. Animated by distant lands,  animal  quarrels , hardened hair, these old men can beg without  humility.  Other beggars have worn themselves out by life. They are the infirm,  crutches, and silly. They are astonished to have reached the goal that  has remained blue and is no longer the horizon. Aging, they have become  mad like kings who would have too many herds of elephants carrying  small citadels. There are travelers who confuse flowers  and stars.  Aged like oxen dying around twenty-five, the young have  led suckling infants to the moon.  On a clear day, women are silent, their bodies are angelic and  their gazes tremble.  Regarding danger, their smiles are internal. They await  terror to confess innocent sins.  * * *  For a year, Picasso lived this wet painting, blue  like the damp bottom of the abyss and pitiful.  Pity made Picasso more bitter. The squares supported a hanged man  stretching against the houses above the slanted passersby. These  tortured awaited a redeemer. The rope miraculously overhung  the attics; the panes blazed with the flowers in the windows.  In bedrooms, poor painters drew fleece-  covered nudes by lamplight. The abandonment of women's shoes near the bed  signified a tender haste.  * * *  Calm came after this frenzy.  Harlequins live beneath the tinsel when the painting gathers,  warms, or whitens its colors to express the strength and duration of  passions, when the lines limited by the jersey curve, intersect  , or soar.  Fatherhood transfigures the harlequin in a square room, while  his wife soaks herself in cold water and admires herself, slender and spindly as much as  her husband, the puppet. A neighboring fireplace warms the caravan. Beautiful  songs intersect, and soldiers pass elsewhere, cursing the  day.  Love is good when you adorn it, and the habit of living at home doubles  the paternal feeling. The child brings the woman Picasso  wanted glorious and immaculate closer to the father.  The mothers, first-time mothers, no longer expected the child, perhaps because  of certain chattering crows and bad omens  \n\n\nChristmas! They gave birth to future acrobats among the familiar monkeys,  legitimate that numbers, block letters appear a  white horses and dogs like bears.  \nThe adolescent sisters, treading in balance on the acrobats' large balls  , command these spheres to the radiant movement  of the worlds. These adolescent girls, immature, have the anxieties of  innocence; the animals teach them religious mystery.  Harlequins accompany the glory of women; they resemble them, neither  male nor female.  \nThe color has the dullness of frescoes, the lines are firm. But  placed at the edge of life, the animals are human and the sexes  undecided.  \nHybrid beasts have the consciousness of the demigods of Egypt;  taciturn harlequins have cheeks and foreheads withered by  morbid sensibilities.  \nThese acrobats cannot be confused with histrions. Their  spectator must be pious, for they celebrate silent rites with  difficult agility. This is what distinguished this painter from the  Greek potters whose drawing sometimes resembled them. On the painted grounds,  bearded, talkative priests offered resigned, destinyless animals as sacrifices  . Here, virility is beardless, but manifests itself in  the sinews of the thin arms; the flatness of the face, and the animals are  mysterious.  \nPicasso's taste for lines that flee, change, and penetrate produced  almost unique examples of linear drypoints in which he did not  alter the general aspects of the world.  \n* * *  \nThis Malagan wounded us like a brief cold. His meditations  were laid bare in silence. He came from afar, from the rich  composition and brutal decoration of the seventeenth-  century Spanish.  \nAnd those who knew him remembered rapid truculences that  were no longer essays.  \nHis insistence on the pursuit of beauty changed everything in  Art.  \n* * *  \nThen, severely, he questioned the universe. He has become accustomed to  the immense light of the depths. And sometimes, he has not disdained to  entrust to the clarity, authentic objects, a two-penny song,  a real postage stamp, a piece of oilcloth on which is  printed the groove of a seat. The art of the painter would not add any  picturesque element to the truth of these objects.  \nSurprise laughs wildly in the purity of the light and these are  picturesque elements, new in art, and long  already imbued with humanity.  \n* * *  \nIt is not possible to guess the possibilities,nor all th  tendencies of an art as profound and meticulous.  \nThe real or trompe-l'oeil object is undoubtedly called upon to play an  increasingly important role. It is the interior frame of the painting and  marks its deep limits, just as the frame marks its  exterior limits.  \n* * *  \nImitating the planes to represent the volumes, Picasso gives the  various elements that compose the objects such a complete  and acute enumeration that they do not take on the form of an object thanks to the work  of the spectators who, by force, perceive their simultaneity, but by  reason of their arrangement.  \nIs this art more profound than elevated? It does not dispense with  the observation of nature and acts on us as familiarly  as nature itself.  \n* * *  \nThere are poets to whom a muse dictates their works, there are  artists whose hand is directed by an unknown being who uses  them as an instrument. For them, there is no fatigue, because they do not  work and can produce a great deal, at any time, every  day, in all countries and in all seasons, they are not men,  but poetic or artistic instruments. Their reason is powerless  against themselves, they do not struggle and their works bear no  traces of struggle. They are not divine and can do  without themselves. They are like the extension of nature and their  works do not pass through intelligence. They can be moving  without the harmonies they arouse being humanized. Other  poets, other artists on the contrary are there who strive, they  go towards nature and have no immediate proximity with it,  they must draw everything from themselves and no demon, no muse  inspires them. They live in solitude and nothing is expressed except what  they themselves have stammered, stammered so often that they  sometimes manage, from effort to effort, from attempt to attempt, to formulate  what they wish to formulate. Men created in the image of God, they will  one day rest to admire their work. But how much fatigue, how  much imperfection, how much coarseness?  \n* * *  \nPicasso was an artist like the first. There has never been a  spectacle as fantastic as this metamorphosis he underwent in  becoming an artist like the second  \n* *   \nFor Picasso, the intention to die was formed while watching the  circumflex eyebrows of his best friend, which were galloping in worry  Another of his friends brought him one day to the confines of a mystical country  where the inhabitants were both so simple and so grotesque that  they could easily be remade.  \nAnd then, truly, anatomy, for example, no longer existed in art;  it had to be reinvented and one's own assassination carried out with the  science and method of a great surgeon.  \n* * *  \nThe great revolution in the arts that he accomplished almost single-handedly is that  the world is his new representation.  \nAn enormous flame.  \nA new man, the world is his new representation. He counts  its elements, its details with a brutality that can also be  graceful. He is a newborn who puts order in the universe for  his personal use, and also to facilitate his relationships with  his fellow men. This counting has the grandeur of the epic, and, with  order, the drama will burst forth. One can dispute a system, an idea,  a date, a resemblance, but I don't see how one could  dispute the simple action of the numerator. From a plastic point of view,  one can find that we could have done without so much truth,  but once this truth has appeared, it becomes necessary. And then, there are  countries. A cave in a forest where people were doing somersaults,  a passage on mule back along the edge of a precipice and the arrival in a  village where everything smells of hot oil and rancid wine. It is also  the walk to a cemetery and the purchase of an earthenware crown  (crown of immortelles) and the mention _A Thousand Regrets_ which is  inimitable. I was also told of clay candelabras that  had to be applied to a canvas so that they appeared to emerge from it.  Crystal pendants, and that famous return from Le Havre.  \nI have no fear of Art and I have no prejudices concerning  the material of painters.  \nMosaicists paint with marble or colored wood.  An Italian painter has been mentioned who painted with fecal matter;  during the French Revolution, someone painted with blood. One can  paint with whatever one wishes, with pipes, postage stamps,  postcards or playing cards, candelabras, pieces of  oilcloth, collars, wallpaper, newspapers.  \nIt is enough for me to see the work, one must see the work,  it is by the quantity of work provided by the artist that one measures  the value of a work of art.  \nDelicate contrasts,parallel lines, a worker's job,  sometimes the object itself, sometimes an indication, sometimes an  enumeration that individualizes itself, less gentleness than coarseness.  One does not choose in the modern, just as one accepts fashion without  discussion.  \nPainting... An astonishing art whose light is limitless.  \n\n\nGeorges BRAQUE  \n\nPeaceful appearances in plastic generalization, this is what  , in a temperate region, joined the art of Georges Braque.  \n* * *  \nGeorges Braque is the first among the new painters, who after his  aesthetic metamorphosis, made contact with the public.  \nThis momentous event took place at the Salon des Indépendants in 1908.  \n* * *  \nThe historical role of the Salon des Indépendants is beginning to be  well defined today.  \nThe art of the 19th century—the art through which  the integrity of French genius was still manifested—is nothing but a long revolt against  academic routine, to which the rebels opposed the  authentic traditions that escape the masters of this degenerate art defended by  the citadel of the Rue Bonaparte.  \nThe Salon des Indépendants has played, since its foundation, a leading role  in the evolution of modern art and in turn it  reveals to us the tendencies and personalities that, for twenty-five years,  have been body and soul with the history of French painting, the only one  that counts today, that pursues before the face of the universe the logic  of the great traditions and that always manifests a great intensity  of life.  \nIt should be added that grotesques do not appear at the Salon des  Indépendants in a proportion greater than that in which they are shown,  with a so-called legitimate art, in the official salons.  \nMoreover, artistic culture, these days, no longer falls under a  social discipline. And it is not the least merit of the art that  manifested itself, in 1908, in a work by Georges Braque, that it was in harmony  with the society in which it evolved.  \nThis fact, which had not occurred since the good period of  Dutch painting, constitutes, in short, the social element of the  Revolution of which Georges Braque was the orator.  \nIt would have been brought forward by two or three years if Picasso had exhibited,  but silence was necessary for him and who knows if the mockery  to which a Georges Braque was then subjected,would not have  diverted a Picasso from the difficult path he had first walked  alone  \nBut in 1909, the revolution that renewed the plastic arts ha  done. The jokes of the public and the critics could no longer  prevent it.  \nPerhaps more than the novelties that appeared in  Braque's paintings, people were surprised that someone among the young painters, without  giving in to the affectation of illustrators, restored order  and craft to honor, without which there is no art.  \n* * *  \nHere then is Georges Braque. His role was heroic. His peaceful art  is admirable. He strives seriously. He expresses a beauty full  of tenderness and the mother-of-pearl of his paintings iridizes our understanding. This  painter is angelic.  \nHe taught men and other painters the aesthetic use of  forms so unknown that only a few poets had suspected them.  These luminous signs shine around us, but  only a few painters have brought out their plastic meaning. Work, especially  in its crudest realizations, contains a multitude  of aesthetic elements whose novelty is always in accord with the  feeling of the sublime that allows man to order chaos: we  must not despise what appears new, or what is soiled or what is of  use to us, the fake wood or the fake marble of house painters. Even if  these appearances seem trivial, it is necessary, when the action demands  a man, that he start from these trivialities.  \nI detest artists who are not of their time and just as  the language of the people was for Malherbe the good language of his time,  the craft of the craftsman, of the house painter should be for  the artist the most vigorous material expression of painting.  \n* * *  \nWe will say: Georges Braque the verifier. He has verified all the  novelties of modern art and will verify more.  \n\n\nJean METZINGER  \n\nNo young contemporary painter has experienced as much injustice as  Jean Metzinger, nor has he shown more stubbornness than this refined artist,  one of the purest there is today. He never refused  to accept the lesson of events. In the painful journey he made  in search of a discipline, Jean Metzinger stopped in  all the well-polished cities he encountered on his way.  \nWe first met him in this elegant and modern  city of Neo-Impressionism, of which Georges Seurat was the founder and  architect.  \n* * *  \nThis great painter is not yet fully appreciated.  \nHis works have,in the design, the composition, the very discretion of th  contrasting luminosities, a style that sets them apart and perhaps well  above most of the works of his contemporary painters.  \nNo painter reminds me of Molière like Seurat, of Molière's  _Bourgeois gentilhomme_ which is a ballet full of grace, lyricism and  common sense. And paintings like _Le Cirque_ or _Le Chahut_ are also  ballets full of grace, lyricism and common sense.  \nThe Neo-Impressionist painters are those who, to quote Paul Signac  ''established and, since 1886, developed the technique known as  division by using as a mode of expression the optical mixture of  tones and shades.'' This technique could be linked to the art  of the Byzantine mosaicists, and I remember that one day, in a letter  addressed to Mr. Charles Morice, Signac also claimed to be a member of the Libreria  of Siena.  \nThis technique, so luminous and which brought order to the  Impressionist novelties, was guessed at, even applied, by  Delacroix, to whom it had been revealed by the examination of  Constable's paintings.  \nIt was Seurat who, in 1886, exhibited the first divided painting. _A  Sunday on La Grande-Jatte._ It was he who carried the contrast of complementaries furthest  in the construction of paintings.  Seurat's influence is felt today as far as the École des  Beaux-Arts and will continue to enrich painting.  \n* * *  \nJean Metzinger played a role among the refined and  laborious Divisionists. However, the colorful minutiae of Neo-Impressionism  still only served to indicate which elements formed the style  of an era which, in almost all its artistic  or industrial manifestations, appeared devoid of it to the eyes of contemporaries.  Seurat, with a precision that one might call genius, drew from his  time some paintings where the firmness of the style is equal to the  almost scientific clarity of the conception, (_Le Chahut, Le Cirque_ which  are almost akin to ''scientific cubism''). He straightened everything  in the art of his time to fix the gestures which characterize this  _fin de siècle_, this end of the 19th century, where everything was angular,  irritating, childishly insolent and sentimentally comic.  \nSuch a beautiful intellectual spectacle could hardly be prolonged  and once the picturesque style which emerges from the art of the 19th century  century had been indicated, neo-impressionism ceased to play   takes on an interesting role. It brought no other novelties than the  contrast of the complementary ones and indicated the aesthetic value of the  novelties that the preceding schools had discovered since the  end of the 18th century. Too many new elements solicited the  young painters. They could not immobilize themselves in an art  which, being the last and strictest expression of an  artistic period, had to give its measure at the first attempt.  \n* * *  \nThis discipline became a boring regulation. The great  colorful cries of the Fauves burst forth in the distance. They attracted Jean Metzinger  and undoubtedly taught him the symbolic meaning of the  colors, the forms they represent and when from this  barbaric and not savage city, given over to luxury and violent orgies, the  Barbarians had gone, the Fauves had ceased to roar, there  remained only a few peaceful bureaucrats who resembled  trait for trait the civil servants of the rue Bonaparte, in Paris. And  the Kingdom of the Fauves, whose civilization seemed so new, so  powerful, so dazzling, suddenly took on the appearance of an abandoned village.  \n* * *  \nIt was then that Jean Metzinger, going to meet Picasso and  Braque, founded the city of the Cubists. Discipline there is strict but  is not yet in danger of becoming a system, and freedom is greater there  than anywhere else.  \n* * *  \nFrom his association with the Neo-Impressionists, Jean Metzinger  retained a taste for meticulousness, a taste that is not mediocre.  \nNothing is unfinished in his work, nothing either that is not the fruit  of rigorous logic, and if he has ever been wrong, which I do not  know and it is of little importance to me to know, it is not by chance.  His work will be one of the most reliable documents when we want  to explain the art of our time. It is thanks to Metzinger's paintings  that we will be able to distinguish between what has aesthetic value  in our art and what does not. A Metzinger painting  always contains its own explanation. This may be a noble  weakness, but it is certainly one of high consciousness and I believe  a unique case in the history of art.  \nAs soon as one approaches a Metzinger painting one feels that the artist had  the firm desire to take seriously only what is serious  and that events, according to a method that seems excellent to me  provide him with the plastic elements of his art. But if h  accepts all, he does not use them haphazardly. His work is sound,  of decadence.What individual characters are there in the painting?  undoubtedly healthier than that of most of his  contemporary artists.It will delight those who like to know the reasons fo  things and these reasons have something to satisfy the mind.  \n* * *  \nJean Metzinger's works have purity. His meditations  take beautiful forms, whose pleasantness tends to approach the  sublime. The new ensembles he composes are entirely  stripped of everything known before him.  \nHis increasingly abstract but always pleasant art addresses and strives  to resolve the most difficult and unforeseen problems of  aesthetics.  \nEach of his works contains a judgment on the universe and his  entire oeuvre resembles the nocturnal firmament when it is free of all clouds  and trembles with adorable gleams.  \nAnd nothing is unfinished in his work; poetry ennobles the smallest  details.  \n\n\nAlbert GLEIZES  \n\nThe works of Albert Gleizes are powerful harmonies, which  must be separated from theoretical cubism as established by  scientific painters. I remember his essays. One could already sense the  desire to reduce his art to its simplest elements. At the  beginning, Albert Gleizes found himself in relation to the flourishing schools:  the last Impressionists, the Symbolists, some of whom  had become the Intimists, the Divisionist Neo-Impressionists,  and the Fauves, in roughly the same situation as the customs officer  Rousseau found himself in relation to the academicism and intellectualism of the  official salons.  \nIt was then that he understood the work of Cézanne, who had influenced  the works of the first Cubists.  \nThen these harmonies developed, which are among the  most serious and most worthy of attention that the plastic arts have produced  over the last ten years.  \nAlbert Gleizes' portraits clearly show that in his art,  as in the art of most new painters, the individuation  of objects is not only the work of the spectators.  \nThe paintings of Albert Gleizes and those of many young painters are often regarded  as timid generalizations.  \nAnd yet in most of the new paintings, the  individual characters are still marked with a firmness, even a meticulousness, which  cannot escape those who have seen the new painters at work,  who have looked at their paintings with a little attention.  \nThe soft generalization is rather the work of intellectual painters  of a Henry de Groux who generalizes the decadent sentiment of the imitators  of Baudelaire,in the paintings of a Zuloaga who generalizes Spai  conventional of the last Romantics? True generalization  involves a deeper individualization that lives in the  light as well as in the very paintings of the Impressionists like  Claude Monet, like Seurat (like Picasso even), who generalize, their  sincerity and have renounced specifying superficial characteristics. There  is not a tree, not a house, not a character to which the  Impressionists have kept an individual character.  \nIt is an Impressionist painter who, before making a portrait,  began by saying that he would not make it a likeness.  \nBut there is a generalization that is even broader and more precise at the  same time. This is why the portrait is one of the important branches  of the art of the new painters. They could always guarantee the  resemblance and I have never seen any of their portraits that was not  a likeness.  \n* * *  \nWhat concern for reality, for individual characters, could  painters like Bouguereau, like Henner have had?  \nIn many new painters, each plastic conception is  still individualized in generalization with a patience that  must be recognized.  \nBecause they are not concerned with chronology, history, or  geography, because they bring together what had not been brought together,  because a Gleizes tries to dramatize the objects he depicts by  releasing the elements of artistic emotion, we can say that the goal of  their art is sublimely precise.  \n* * *  \nAll the figures in Albert Gleizes' paintings are not the same  figure, all the trees, a tree, all the rivers, a river, but  the spectator, if he can rise to general ideas, will be able  to generalize this figure, this tree or this river because  the work of the painter has raised these objects to a higher degree of  plasticity, has a degree of plasticity such that all the elements that  constitute their individual characteristics are represented with the same  dramatic majesty.  \n* * *  \nMajesty is what characterizes Albert Gleizes' art above all.  He thus brought a moving novelty to contemporary art.  It is found before him in only a few modern painters. This majesty  awakens the imagination, provokes the imagination, and considered from a plastic point of  view, it is the immensity of things.  \n* * *  \nThis art is vigorous.Albert Gleizes' paintings are made by  a force of the same kind as those that created the Pyramids and the  cathedrals, that create the metal constructions, the bridges and  the tunnels.  \nThese works sometimes have this slightly clumsy side of great works, of  those that humanity places the highest because in fact the intention of  the one who made them was always to do the best possible. And the  purest feeling that an artist can have of his art is to do  his best and it is a low one to be content to succeed in his works  without effort, without work, without having done the best possible.\n\n\nMiss Marie LAURENCIN  \n\nOur era has allowed female talents to flourish in  Letters and in the Arts.  \nWomen bring to art a new and  joyful vision of the universe.  \nThere have been women painters in all eras, and this  marvelous art offers such delicate charms to the attention and the imagination  that one would not be surprised if there had been a greater  number of female painters.  \nThe 16th century in Italy produced Sophonisba Angussola, celebrated by  Lanzi and Vasari. Paul IV and the King of Spain fought over her  works. There are some in Madrid, Florence, Genoa, and London. The Louvre  does not possess any. Born in Cremona around 1530, she quickly surpassed her  master Bernadino and carried the art of portraiture far. Modern artists have  sometimes attributed some of these paintings to Titian himself. After  achieving the greatest success at the court of Philip II, she  eventually retired to Genoa, where she became blind. Lanzi said that she  was considered the person of her century who reasoned best on the  arts, and Van Dyck, who came to listen to her, affirmed that he had learned more  from this blind old woman than from the most clairvoyant painter.  \nSophonisba Angussola, is until now the highest example of a  feminine glory acquired thanks to the plastic arts.  \n* * *  \nMiss Marie Laurencin, knew how to express, in the major art of painting,  an entirely feminine aesthetic.  \nFrom her first paintings, her first drawings, her first etchings  , although these attempts were distinguished only by a certain  natural simplicity, one could guess that the artist who was  soon to reveal himself would one day express the grace and charm of the world  \nShe then produced paintings where the arabesques became  delicate figures  \nSince then, through her research, we always find this  feminine arabesque, the knowledge of which she has managed to keep intact.  \nWhile a Picasso is concerned, by exalting the still  unknown picturesqueness of an object, to make it render all that it can give  in terms of aesthetic emotion. Miss Laurencin, whose art is derived from those  of Henri Matisse and Picasso, devotes herself, above all, to expressing the  picturesque novelty of objects and figures. Also, her art is  less severe than that of Picasso, an art with which, however, hers  is not without analogies. This is because it is the numbering of the elements  that compose her painting. She thus attaches herself to nature, studying it  relentlessly, but carefully setting aside what is neither young nor  graceful, and the unknown elements of things, she only welcomes them  if they appear in a youthful aspect.  \nI think that it was deliberately that she thus oriented her art  towards young novelty, whether serious or cheerful. The feminine aesthetic, which  until now had hardly been shown except in the applied arts such as  lace and embroidery, had above all to express in painting the  very novelty of this femininity. Later, there would come women who  would explore other feminine aspects of the universe.  \nAs an artist, one can place Miss Laurencin between Picasso and the  customs officer Rousseau. This is not a hierarchical indication but  a simple observation of kinship. Her art dances like Salome between  that of Picasso, the new John the Baptist who washes the Arts in the  baptism of light, and that of Rousseau, the sentimental Herod,  the sumptuous and childish old man whom love brought to the confines of  intellectualism, it is there that the angels came to distract his  pain, they prevented him from penetrating into the dreadful kingdom of which he  had become the Customs Officer and this old man, finally, they admired him  in their troupe and heavy wings came to him.  \n* * *  \nArtistic youth has already testified to the honor in which it holds the  works of that poor old angel, Henri Rousseau, _the Customs Officer_,  who died in 1910, at the end of the summer. He could also be called the  master of Piacenza, as much because of the district where he lived as  because of what makes his paintings so pleasant to look at.  \nFew artists have been more mocked during their lives than the Customs Officer,  and few men opposed a calmer front to the mockery,to the  vulgarities with which he was bombarded. This courteous old man retained  always the same tranquility of humor and by a happy turn of  character,he wanted to see in the mockery itself the interest that th  The most malicious towards him were in some way obliged to  show his work. This serenity was only pride, of  course. The Douanier was aware of his strength. He once  or twice failed to say that he was the strongest painter of his  time. And it is possible that on many points he was not  far wrong. This is because if he lacked an  artistic education in his youth (and this is felt), it seems that, later on,  when he wanted to paint, he looked at the masters with passion and  that almost alone among the moderns, he guessed their secrets.  \nHis faults consist only sometimes in an excess of sentiment,  almost always in a popular bonhomie above which  he could not have risen and which contrasted a little strongly with his  artistic enterprises and with the attitude that he had been able to take in  contemporary art.  \nBut besides that, how many qualities! And it is very significant that  artistic youth has guessed them! We can congratulate him, especially  if his intention is not only to honor them, but also to  collect them.  \nLe Douanier went to the very end of his paintings, something very rare  today. We find there no mannerism, no process, no  system. From this comes the variety of his work. He did not mistrust  his imagination any more than he did his hand. From this come the grace and  richness of his decorative compositions. As he had campaigned  in Mexico, he had kept a  very precise plastic and poetic memory of tropical vegetation and fauna.  \nAs a result, this Breton, an old inhabitant of the Parisian suburbs,  is without a doubt the strangest, the most audacious and the most  charming of the painters of exoticism. His _Snake Charmer_  shows this well enough. But Rousseau was not only a decorator, he  was not an image maker either, he was a painter. And this is what  makes understanding his works so difficult for some people.  He had order, and this is noticeable not only in his  paintings, but also in his drawings, ordered like Persian miniatures  . His art had purity; it contains in the  female figures, in the construction of the trees, in the harmonious song  of the different tones of the same color, a style that belongs only  only to French painters,and which indicates the French tables wher  to them. I am speaking, of course, of the paintings of the masters.  \nThe will of this painter was of the strongest.How can we doubt it  in front of his minutiae which are not weaknesses, how can one doubt it  when the song of the blues rises, the melody of the whites in this  _Noce_ where the figure of an old peasant woman brings to mind certain  Dutchmen.  \nAs a painter of portraits, Rousseau is incomparable. A  half-length portrait of a woman with delicate blacks and grays is pushed further  than a portrait of Cézanne. I twice had the honor of being  painted by Rousseau, in his small, bright studio on rue Perrel, I  often saw him working and I know what care he had for all the  details, what ability he had to keep the primitive and  definitive conception of his painting until he had finished it and also that he  left nothing to chance and especially nothing essential.  \nAmong Rousseau's beautiful sketches, nothing is so astonishing as  the small canvas entitled _La Carmagnole._ (This is the sketch for the  _Centenary of Independence_, under which Rousseau had written:  \n           Near my blonde       How good it is, how good it is, how good it is...)  \nA nervous drawing, the variety, the pleasantness and the delicacy of the tones  make this sketch an excellent little piece. His paintings of  flowers show the resources of charm and accent which were in  the soul and the hand of the old Douanier.  \n* * *  \nMoreover, it can be noted here that these three painters,  between whom I establish no hierarchy, but whose  degrees of kinship I seek to discern quite simply, are  portraitists of the highest order.  \nIn Picasso's brilliant work, portraits occupy an  important place and some of them (the _portrait of Mr. Vollard_, the  _portrait of Mr. Kahnweiler_) will take their place among the masterpieces.  The portraits of the customs officer Rousseau appear to me as prodigious works  , whose full beauty we are still unable to measure  . The portraits also form an important part of Miss Laurencin's work  .  \nThe prophetic element of Picasso's work and the intellectual element  which, despite everything, entered into Rousseau's painting, the painting  of an old man, all this is here transformed into an  entirely new picturesque element. It is analogous to dance and it is in  painting an infinitely graceful rhythmic numbering.    Everything which until now composed originality,the delicacy of the art  feminine in lace, embroidery, the Bayeux Tapestry, etc.,  we find it here transfigured, purified.Feminine art has becom  a major art and it will no longer be confused with masculine art.  Feminine art is made of bravery, courtesy, joy. It dances  in the light and languishes in memory. It has never known  imitation, it has never descended to the baseness of perspective.  It is a happy art.  \nRegarding one of Mlle Laurencin's most tender paintings, _La  Toilette_, Mr. Mario Meunier, then secretary to Mr. Rodin and an  excellent translator of Sappho, Sophocles, and Plato, told an  amusing anecdote. He showed the sculptor some photographs representing  paintings from the Fauve school; there was also, by chance,  the reproduction of Mlle Laurencin's painting: ''At least,'' said the illustrious  old man, ''here is one who is not just a _warbler_, she knows what  grace is, she is serpentine.''  \nThat's it: feminine painting is serpentine and it is perhaps  this great artist of movement and colors, Loïe Füller, who  was the precursor of feminine art today when she invented these  successive lights where painting, dance and grace were mixed  and which were rightly called: the serpentine dance.  \nAnd it is with regard to another woman's work that  Rodin's perceptive humor found this word again!  \nFeminine art, the art of Mlle Laurencin, tends to become a pure  arabesque humanized by the attentive observation of nature and which,  being expressive, moves away from simple decoration while remaining  just as pleasant.  \n\n\nJuan GRIS  \n\nHere is the man who has meditated on everything that is modern, here is  the artist-painter who wants to conceive only new ensembles, who  would like to draw, paint only materially pure forms.  \n* * *  \nHis buffooneries were sentimental. He wept as in  romances instead of laughing as in Bacchic songs. He  still does not know that color is a form of reality. And here he is discovering  the minutiae of thought. He discovers them one by one and his first  canvases have the appearance of preparations for masterpieces. Little by little  the little geniuses of painting come together. The pale hills  are populated. The bluish flames of gas stoves, the skies  with the drooping shapes of weeping willows, wet leaves.  He preserves in his paintings the damp aspect of newly  .Wallpaper on the walls of a bedroom, a top ha  shaped facades, the disorder of posters on a large wall,all this can  serve to animate a canvas, to give the painter a limit i  what he sets out to paint. The large forms thus acquire  a sensitivity. They are no longer boring. This art of ornament  strives to piously collect and revive the last vestiges  of classical art, such as the drawings of Ingres and the portraits of  David. It achieves style as did Seurat without having any of his  theoretical novelty.  \n* * *  \nIt is certainly in this direction that Juan Gris is seeking. His  painting moves away from music, that is to say that it strives above  all for scientific reality. Juan Gris has drawn from the studies that  connect him to his only master, Picasso, a drawing that appeared at first  geometric and which is characterized even in style.  \n* * *  \nThis art, if it progresses in the direction it has taken, could  end not in scientific abstraction but in the  aesthetic arrangement which, ultimately, can be considered the highest goal  of scientific art. No more forms suggested by the painter's skill  , no more colors even which are also suggested forms.  Objects would be used whose capricious arrangement would have an  aesthetic meaning that would not be deniable. However, the impossibility of  putting a flesh-and-blood man, a  mirrored wardrobe or the Eiffel Tower on a canvas will force the painter to return to the methods  of true painting, or to limit his talent to developing  the minor art of the watch—today there are admirably arranged shop windows  —or that of the upholsterer, unless it  is that of the landscape gardener.  The last two minor arts have not been without influence on  painters, that of the watch will have a similar influence. It will cause  no harm to painting because it cannot replace it  for the representation of perishable objects. Juan Gris is too much of  a painter to renounce painting.  * * *  We may see him attempt this great art of surprise, his  intellectualism and the attentive study of nature would provide him  with unforeseen elements from which the style would emerge as it emerges  today from the metal constructions of engineers: department  stores, garages, railways, airplanes. Since art today has  only a very limited social role to fulfill, it is only right that it give itself  The art of Juan Gris is an expression too rigorous and to  \n\nIt is right that he should take upon himself  the disinterested task of studying scientifically and even without an  aesthetic design, the immense extent of its domain.  \n* * *  \npoor scientific cubism, stemming from Picasso; deeply  intellectualist art where color has only a symbolic meaning.  However, while Picasso's art is conceived in light  (impressionism), Juan Gris's is content with purity conceived  scientifically.  \n* * *  \nJuan Gris's conceptions always take on a pure appearance and from  this purity will, no doubt, one day, spring parallels.  \n\n\nFernand LÉGER  \n\nFernand Léger is one of the most gifted artists of his generation. He did not  linger long on this post-impressionist painting which  dates from barely yesterday and already seems so distant to us. I saw some of  Léger's attempts at his beginnings in art.  \nEvening bathing, the horizontal sea, heads already scattered as  in the difficult compositions that only Henri Matisse had tackled.  \nThen, after entirely new drawings, Léger wanted to devote himself  to pure painting.  \nThe woodcutters bore the marks of the blows their axes  left on the trees, and the general color was part of the  deep, greenish light that descends from the foliage.  \n* * *  \nLéger's work was then a fairyland in which smiling figures  drowned in perfumes. Indolent figures who voluptuously  transform the city light into multiple and delicate  shaded colors, memories of Norman orchards. All the  colors bubble. Then, a vapor rises from them, and when it  has dissipated, here are the chosen colors. A sort of masterpiece was born from this passion; it is called  _The Smoker._ There is thus  \n, in Léger, a desire to draw from a composition all  the aesthetic emotion it can give. Here he is, bringing a landscape  to the highest degree of plasticity.  \nHe removes from it everything that does not help to give his conception the  pleasant aspect of a happy simplicity.  \nHe is one of the first who, resisting the ancient instinct of the species,  that of the race, happily gave themselves over to the instinct of the  civilization in which he lives.  \nIt is an instinct that many more people resist than one might  think. In others it becomes a grotesque frenzy, the frenzy of  ignorance. In others, finally, it consists of taking advantage of everything  that comes to us through the five senses.  \nWhen I see a painting by Léger, I am very happy.It is no  a stupid transposition where we have applied some skills of  .Nor is it a work whose author has mad  what everyone wanted to do today. There are so many who want to  remake a soul, a profession like in the 15th or 14th century, there are  even more skillful ones who forge for you a soul of the century of Augustus or  that of Pericles, in less time than it takes a child to  learn to read. No, with Léger it is not one of those men  who believe that the humanity of one century is different from that of  another century and who confuse God with a costume designer, while waiting to  confuse their costume with their soul. It is an artist similar  to those of the 14th and 15th centuries, to those of the time of Augustus or  Pericles; no more, no less, and for glory and masterpieces,  let the painter help himself, heaven will help him.  \n* * *  \nThe sculptor Manolo, when he was going through difficult times,  once went to an art dealer, who had a reputation for  willingly protecting unknown talents.  \nManolo intended to sell him some drawings and he  announced himself.  \nThe dealer told Manolo that he didn't know him.  \n''Go tell Mr. Expert that I am Phidias,'' replied Manolo.  \nBut the dealer replied that he didn't know that name  .  \n''Then tell him it was Praxiteles he didn't want to receive.'' And  the sculptor left.  \n* * *  \nCertainly, Phidias or Praxiteles or Manolo could be there, but one doesn't  rebuild one's soul like Phidias. And most men disguise themselves.  It's easy to understand why there are always so few modern artists.  Most are disguised. The Salons contain little more than  carnival accessories. I like authentic works of art. Those  that were conceived by souls that have not been remade.  \n* * *  \nHere you are, beautiful, hues, light colors, and you,  bubbling forms; the pleasant fumes are the emblem of civilizations.  \nThis lopsided sky is the sky of our streets, it has been cut out and  made to stand upright. The infinite softness of raspberry-colored roofs. And even  if a hand had six fingers, if this man had three feet.  \nDo not believe that there is any mysticism here. Oh! I do not  despise him. He terrifies me in admiration. Let him come, one day,  this great mystical artist; let God command him, let him force him, let him  order him. He will be there,perhaps it is there, very close, his name, I  know, but we must not say it, we will know it one day,It is  better not to tell him; what happiness for him: if he could ignor  his mission, to ignore that he is suffering and also that he is always in danger  here below!  \n* * *  \nBut Fernand Léger is not a mystic, he is a painter, a simple  painter and I rejoice as much in his simplicity as in the solidity of  his judgment.  \nI love his art because it is not disdainful, because it does not commit  base acts either and because it is not argumentative. I love your  _light_ colors, oh Fernand Léger. Fantasy will not elevate you  to the realm of magic, yet it gives you all your joys.  \nHere, joy is in the design as well as in the execution. He  will find other effervescences. The same orchards will deliver  lighter colors. Other families will scatter like  the droplets of a waterfall and the rainbow will come to  sumptuously clothe the tiny dancers of the corps-de-ballet. The  wedding party is hiding behind each other. One more small  effort to get rid of perspective, the miserable thing of  perspective, of this fourth dimension in reverse, perspective,  this means of inevitably shrinking everything.  \nBut, this painting is liquid, the sea, the blood, the rivers, the  rain, a glass of water and also our tears, with the sweat of great  efforts and long fatigues, the humidity of kisses.  \n\n\nFrancis PICABIA  \n\nStarting from Impressionism like most contemporary painters,  Francis Picabia had, with the Fauves, transposed light into  colors. It is from there that he came to this entirely new art  where color is no longer just coloring, is no longer even a  luminous transposition, finally no longer has any symbolic meaning,  because it is itself the form and the light of what is represented.  \nHe thus approached an art where, as in that of Robert Delaunay, the  ideal dimension is color. It therefore has all  the other dimensions. However, in Picabia, form is still  symbolic when color should be formal; a perfectly  legitimate art that can be considered extremely elevated. Color  in this art is saturated with energy and its extremities continue in  space. Reality here is matter. Color no longer depends on the  three known dimensions; it creates them.  \n* * *    This art has as much to do with music as it can have with it  an art that is its opposite.We can well say of Picabia's art  that it would like to be to ancient painting what music is to  literature, but one cannot say that it is music. Indeed,  music proceeds by suggestion; here, on the contrary, we are presented with  colors that should no longer impress us as symbols,  but as concrete forms. However, without approaching new means  , an artist like Picabia deprives himself here of one of the principal  elements of universal painting: conception. For the artist  to be able to deprive himself of it in appearance, color would have to be formal (material  and dimension: measure).  \nLet us add that the indication of the title is not, for Picabia, an  intellectual element foreign to the art to which he has devoted himself. This  indication must play the role of an interior framework, as do  authentic objects in Picasso's paintings, and  exactly copied inscriptions. It must ward off the intellectualism of decadence  and ward off the danger that there is always for painters of becoming  literary men. Picabia's written title, the authentic objects,  the molded letters and numbers from the paintings of Picasso and  Braque, we find the picturesque equivalent in the paintings  of Mlle Laurencin, in the form of deep arabesques; in the  paintings of Albert Gleizes, in the form of right angles that hold the  light, in the paintings of Fernand Léger, in the form of bubbles, in  the paintings of Metzinger, in the form of vertical lines, parallel  to the sides of the frame and cut by rare steps. We would find  the equivalent in all the great painters. It is intended to give  picturesque intensity to a work of painting and this role says  enough that it is legitimate.  \nThis is how one keeps oneself from becoming a literary painter, this is  how Picabia tried to devote himself entirely to colors,  without however daring, in approaching the subject, to give them a personal existence  . (Note that the indication of a title does not mean  that the artist is addressing a subject.)  \nPaintings like _The Landscape, The Spring, Dances at the Spring_, are  therefore indeed paintings: colors that unite or contrast,  that take a direction in space, degrade or increase  in intensity to provoke aesthetic emotion.  \nIt is not a question of abstraction, because the pleasure that these works  intend to give to the spectator is direct. Surprise plays an  important role.Are we going to say that the flavor of a peach is only on  abstraction? Each of Picabia's paintings has its own limited existence  whose details can be scrutinized, whose details can be copied.These traces  by the title he gave it. These paintings represent so little o  abstractions _a priori_ that of each of them, the painter could  tell you the story and the painting of the _Dances at the Spring_ is only  the realization of a natural plastic emotion felt in the  surroundings of Naples.  \nThe possibilities of aesthetic emotion enclosed in this art, if  it were pure, would be immense. He could take Poussin's words to heart  : ''Painting has no goal other than the delight and  joy of the eyes.''  \n* * *  \nPicabia, who seems to desire an art of mobility, could abandon  static painting to now approach new means (as  did Loïe Füller). But as a painter of pictures, I advise him  to frankly approach the subject (poetry) which is the essence of the  plastic arts.  \n\n\nMarcel DUCHAMP  \n\nThe paintings of Marcel Duchamp are not yet numerous enough and they  differ too much from one another for one to be able to draw from the indications they  provide a judgment on the true talent of their author. Like  most new painters, Marcel Duchamp no longer worships  appearances. (It seems that it was Gauguin who first renounced  what had been the religion of painters for so long.)  \nIn his early days, Marcel Duchamp was influenced by Braque (paintings exhibited  at the Salon d'Automne 1911 and Galerie de la rue Tronchet 1911) and by  Delaunay's _Tower_ (_Melancholic Young Man on a Train_).  \n* * *  \nTo remove from his art all perceptions that could become  notions, Duchamp wrote on his painting the title he gave it.  Thus, literature, which so few painters have done without, disappears  from his art, but not poetry. He then uses forms and  colors, not to render appearances, but in order to penetrate the  very nature of these formal forms and colors that despair  painters to the point that they would like to do without them and which they  will try to do without whenever possible.  \nMarcel Duchamp opposes, to the concrete composition of his paintings,  an extremely intellectual title. In this sense, he goes as far as  possible and does not fear incurring the reproach of making an  esoteric, if not abstruse, painting.  \n* * *  \nAll men, all beings who have passed close to us have left  traces in our memory and these traces of life have a reality, thus acquiring all together a personality whose  individual characteristic  thus all together acquire a personality that can be described  as intellectual.  \n* * *  \nThere are traces of these beings in the paintings of Marcel Duchamp.  \nAllow me here an observation that has its importance. Duchamp  is the only painter of the modern school who is concerned today  (Autumn 1912) with nudes: (_The King and Queen surrounded by vile nudes;  The King and Queen crossed by fast nudes, Nude descending a  staircase_).  \n* * *  \nThis art that strives to aestheticize such musical perceptions of  nature forbids itself the caprice, and the inexpressive arabesque of music.  \nAn art that would give itself the goal of releasing from nature, not  intellectual generalizations but collective forms and colors  whose perception has not yet become a notion is very  conceivable and it seems that a painter like Marcel Duchamp is in the process  of realizing it.  \nIt is possible that to be moving these unknown, profound  and suddenly grandiose aspects of nature do not need to be  aestheticized, which would explain the flaming aspect of the colors, the  N-shaped compositions, the sometimes tender, sometimes  firmly accentuated swarms. These conceptions are not determined by an  aesthetic but by the energy of a small number of lines (forms or  colors).  \nThis art can produce works of a force of which we have no idea. It  may even be that it plays a social role.  \nJust as a work by Cimabue was paraded, our century  saw  Blériot's airplane paraded triumphantly to be taken to the Arts-et-Métiers, fully charged with humanity, with thousand-year-old efforts,  with necessary art. It will perhaps be reserved for an artist as free  from aesthetic concerns, as preoccupied with energy as Marcel  Duchamp, to reconcile Art and the People  "}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The new spirit which will dominate the poetry of the entire world has nowhere come to light as it has in France. The strong intellectual discipline which the French have always imposed on themselves permits them, as well as their spiritual kin, to have a conception of life, of the arts and of letters, which, without being simply the recollection of antiquity, is also not the counterpart of romantic prettiness.\nThe new spirit which is making itself heard strives above all to inherit from the classics a sound good sense, a sure critical spirit, perspectives on the universe and on the soul of man, and the sense of duty which lays bare our feelings and limits or rather contains their manifestations.\nIt strives further to inherit from the romantics a curiosity which will incite it to explore all the domains suitable for furnishing literary subject matter which will permit life to be exalted in whatever form it occurs.\nTo explore truth, to search for it, as much in the ethnic domain, for example, as in that of the imagination—those arc the principal characteristics of the new spirit.\nThis tendency, moreover, has always had its bold proponents, although they were unaware of it; for a long time it has been taking shape and making progress.\nHowever, this is the first time that it has appeared fully conscious of itself. Up to now the literary field has been kept within narrow limits. One wrote in prose or one wrote in verse. In prose, rules of grammar established the form.\nAs for poetry, rimed versification was the only rule, which underwent periodical attacks, but which was never shaken.\nFree verse gave wings to lyricism; but it was only one stage of the exploration that can be made in the domain of form.\nThe investigations of form have subsequently assumed a great importance. Is it not understandable\nHow could the poet not be interested in these investigations which can lead to new discoveries in thought and lyricism?\n \nAssonance, alliteration as well as rime are conventions, each of which has its merits.\nTypographical artifices worked out with great audacity have the advantage of bringing to life a visual lyricism which was almost unknown before our age. These artifices can still go much further and achieve the synthesis of the arts, of music, painting, and literature.\nThat is only one search for attaining new and perfectly legitimate expressions.\nWho would dare to say that rhetorical exercises, the variations on the theme of: I die of thirst beside the fountain did not have a determining influence on Villon? Who would dare to say the investigations of form of the rhetoricians and of the Marotic* school did not serve to purify the French style up to its flowering in the seventeenth century?\nIt would have been strange if in an epoch when the popular art par excellence, the cinema, is a book of pictures, the poets had not tried to compose pictures for meditative and refined minds which are not content with the crude imaginings of the makers of films. These last will become more perceptive, and one can predict the day when, the photograph and the cinema having become the only form of publication in use, the poet will have a freedom heretofor unknown.\nOne should not be astonished if, with only the means they have now at their disposal, they set themselves to preparing this new art (vaster than the plain art of words) in which, like conductors of an orchestra of unbelievable scope, they will have at their disposition the entire world, its noises and its appearances, the thought and language of man, song, dance, all the arts and all the artifices, still more mirages than Morgane could summon up on the hill of Gibel, with which to compose the visible and unfolded book of the future.\nBut generally you will not find in France the ''words at liberty'' which have been reached by the excesses of the Italian and Russian futurists, the_. extravagant offspring of the new spirit, for France abhors disorder. She readily questions fundamentals, but she has a horror of chaos.\nWe can hope, then, in regard to what constitutes the material and the manner of art, for a liberty of unimaginable opulence. Today the poets are serving their apprenticeship to this encyclopaedic liberty. In the realm of inspiration, their liberty can not be less than that of a daily newspaper which on a single sheet treats the most diverse matters and ranges over the most distant countries. One wonders why the poet should not have at least an equal freedom, and should be restricted, in an era of the telephone, the wireless, and aviation, to a greater cautiousness in confronting space.\nThe rapidity and simplicity with which minds have become accustomed to designating by a single word such complex beings as a crowd, a nation, the universe, do not have their modern counterpart in poetry. Poets are filling the gap, and their synthetic poems are creating new entities which have a plastic value as carefully composed as that of collective terms.\nMan has familiarised himself with those formidable beings which we know as machines, he has explored the domain of the infinitely small, and new domains open up for the activity of his imagination: that of the infinitely large and that of prophecy.\nDo not believe that this new spirit is complicated, slack, artificial, and frozen. In keeping with the very order of nature, the poet puts aside any high-flown purpose. There is no longer any Wagnerianism in us, and the young authors have cast far away all the enchanted clothing of the mighty romanticism of Germany and Wagner, just as they have rejected the rustic tinsel of our early evaluations of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nI do not believe that social developments will ever go so far that one will not be able to speak of national literature. On the contrary, however far one advances on the path of new 'freedoms, they will only reinforce most of the ancient disciplines and bring out new ones which will not be less demanding than the old. This is why I think that, whatever happens, art increasingly has a country. Furthermore, poets must always express a milieu, a nation; and artists, just as poets, just as philosophers, form a social estate which belongs doubtless to all humanity, but as the expression of a race, of one given environment.\nArt will only cease being national the day that the whole universe, living in the same climate, in houses built in the same style, speaks the same language with the same accent—that is to say never. From ethnic and national differences are born the variety of literary expressions, and it is that very variety which must be preserved.\nA cosmopolitan lyric expression would only yield shapeless works without character or individual structure, which would have the value of the commonplaces of international parliamentary rhetoric. And notice that the cinema, which is the perfect cosmopolitan art, already shows ethnic differences immediately apparent to everyone, and film enthusiasts immediately distinguish between an American and an Italian film. Likewise the new spirit, which has the ambition of manifesting a universal spirit and which does not intend to limit its activity, is none the less, and claims to respect the fact, a particular and lyric expression of the French nation, just as the classic spirit is, par excellence, a sublime expression of the same nation.\nIt must not be forgotten that it is perhaps more dangerous for a nation to allow itself to be conquered intellectually than by arms. That is why the new spirit asserts above all an order and a duty which are the great classic qualities manifested by French genius; and to them it adds liberty. This liberty and this order, which combine in the new spirit, are its characteristic and its strength.\nHowever, this synthesis of the arts which has been consummated in our time, must not degenerate into confiuion. That is to say that it would be, if not dangerous, at least absurd, for example to reduce poetry to a sort of imitative harmony which would not have the excuse of exactness.\nOne is right to imagine that imitative harmony can play a role, but it will be the basis only of an art in which machinery plays a part; for example, a poem or a symphony composed on a phonograph might well consist. of noises artistically chosen and lyrically blended or juxtaposed; whereas, for my part, I think it wrong that a poem should be composed simply of the imitation. of a noise to which no lyric, tragic, or pathetic meaning can be attached. And if a few poets devote themselves to this game, it should be regarded only as an exercise, a sort of rough notation of what they will include in a finished work. The '' brekeke koax '' of Aristophanes' Frogs is nothing if one separates it from the work in which it takes on all its comic and satiric meaning. The prolonged '' iiii'' sounds, lasting a whole line, of Francis Jammes' bird are a sorry harmony if they are detached from the poem to whose total fantasy they give precision.\nWhen a modern poet notes in several lines the throbbing sound of an airplane, it must be regarded above all as the desire of the poet to accustom his sensibility to reality. His passion for truth impels him to take almost scientific notes which, if he wishes to present them as poems, have the faults of being trompe-oreilles so to speak, to which actuality will always be superior.\nOn the other hand, if he wants for example to amplify the art of the dance and attempt a choreography whose buffoons would not restrict themselves to entrechats but would utter cries setting off the harmony with an imitative novelty, that is a search which is not absurd, whose popular origins are found in all peoples among whom war dances, for example, are almost always embellished with savage cries.\nTo come back to the concern with truth and the verisimilitude which rules all investigation, all attempts, all efforts of the new spirit, it must be added that there is no ground for astonishment if a certain number or even a great many of them remain sterile for the moment and sink into ridicule. The new spirit is full of dangers and snares.\nAll that, however, belongs to the spirit of today, and to condemn categorically these trials and efforts would be to make an error of the kind which, rightly or wrongly, is attributed to M. Thiers in declaring that the railroads were only a scientific game and that the world could not produce enough iron to build rails from Paris to Marseilles.\nThe new spirit, therefore, admits even hazardous literary experience, and those experiences are at times anything but lyric. This is why lyricism is only one domain of the new spirit in today's poetry, which often contents itself with experiments and investigations without concerning itself over giving them lyric significance. They are materials which the poet amasses, which the new spirit amasses, and these materials will form a basis of truth whose simplicity and modesty must never give pause, for their consequences can be very great things.\nAt a later date, those who study the literary history of our time will be amazed that, like the alchemists, the dreamers and poets devoted themselves, without even the pretext of a philosopher's stone, to inquiries and to notations which exposed them to the ridicule of their contempor-aries, of journalists and of snobs.\nBut their inquiries will be useful; they will be the foundation of a new realism which will perhaps not be inferior to that so poetic and learned realism of ancient Greece.\nWith Alfred Jarry, moreover, we have seen laughter rise from the lower region where it was writhing, to furnish the poet with a totally new lyricism. Where is the time when Desdemona's handkerchief seemed to be an inadmissible ridiculousness? Today even ridicule is sought after, it must be seized upon and it has its place in poetry because it is a part of life in the same way as heroism and all that formerly nourished a poet's enthusiasm.\nThe romantics have tried to give to things of rude appearance a horrible or tragic meaning. It would be better to say that they only worked for the benefit of what is horrible. They wanted to establish the horrible much more than the melancholy. The new spirit does not seek to transform ridicule; it conserves for it a role which is not without flavour. Likewise it does not seem to give a sense of nobility to the horrible. It leaves it horrible and does not debase the noble. It is not a decorative art. Nor is it an impressionist art. It is ,every study of exterior and interior nature, it is all eagerness for truth.\nEven if it is true that there is nothing new under the sun, the new spirit does not refrain from discovering new profundities in all this that is not new under the sun. Good sense is its guide, and this guide leads it into corners, if not new, at least unknown.\nBut is there nothing new under the sun? It remains to be seen.\nWhat! My head has been X-rayed. I have seen, while I live, my own cranium, and that would be nothing new?\nSolomon spoke for the Queen of Sheba, no doubt, and he liked novelty so well that his concubines were without number.\nThe air is filled with strangely human birds. Machines, the daughters of man and having no mother, live a life from which passion and feeling are absent, and would that be nothing new?\nWise men ceaselessly investigate new universes which arc discovered at every crossroads of matter, and there is nothing new under the sun For the sun perhaps. But for men!\nThere are a thousand natural combinations which have not yet been composed. Men will conceive them and use them to good purpose, composing thus with nature that supreme art which is life. These new combinations, these new works—they are the art of life, which is called progress. In this sense, progress exists. But if it is held to consist in an eternal becoming, a sort of messianism as appalling as the fable of Tantalus, Sisyphus, and the Danaidae, then Solomon was right over all the prophets of Israel.\nWhat is new exists without being progress. Everything is in the effect of surprise. The new spirit depends equally on surprise, on what is most vital and new in it. Surprise is the greatest source of what is new. It is by surprise, by the important position that has been given to surprise, that the new spirit distinguishes itself from all the literary and artistic movements which have preceded it.\nIn this respect, it detaches itself from all of them and belongs only to our time.\nWe have established it on the solid basis of good sense and ofexperience which have induced us to accept things and feelings only according to truth, and it is according to truth that we admit them, not seeking at all to make sublime what is naturally ridiculous or vice versa. And from these truths surprise is most often the result, since they run counter to commonly held opinion. Many of these truths have not been examined; it is enough to unveil them to cause surprise.\nOne can likewise express a supposed truth so as to cause surprise, simply because no one has yet dared to present it thus. But a supposed truth is not opposed by good sense, without which it would no longer be truth, even supposed truth. That is why I imagine that, if women could bear no more children, men could make them, and why in showing it to be so I express a literary truth which could only be termed a fable outside of literature, and I thus cause surprise. But my supposed truth is no more extraordinary or unbelievable than those of the Greeks, which show Minerva coming armed out of the head of Jupiter.\nInsofar as airplanes did not fill the sky, the fable of Icarus was only a supposed truth. Today, it is no longer a fable. And our inventors have accustomed us to greater prodigies than that which consists in delegating to men the function which women have of bearing children. I should say further that, these fables having been even more than realized, it is up to the poet to imagine new ones which inventors can in turn realize.\nThe new spirit requires that these prophetic ventures be accepted. It is why you will find traces of prophecy in most works conceived in the new spirit. The divine games of life and imagination give free rein to a totally new poetic activity.\nIt is that poetry and creation are one and the same; only that man can be called poet who invents, who creates insofar as a man can create. The poet is he who discovers new joys, even if they are hard to bear. One can be a poet in any field: it is enough that one be adventuresome and pursue any new discovery.\nThe richest domain being the imagination, the least known, whose extent is infinite, it is not astonishing that the name of poet has been particularly reserved for those who look for the new joys which mark out the enormous spaces of the imagination.\nThe least fact is for a poet the postulate, the point of departure for an unknown immensity where the fires of joy flame up in multiple meanings.\nThere is no need, in undertaking discovery, to choose with the reassuring support of any rules, even those decreed by taste, a quality classified as sublime. One can begin with an everyday event: a dropped handkerchief can be for the poet the lever with which to move an entire universe. It is well known how much an apple's fall meant to Newton when he saw it, and that scholar can thus be called a poet. That is why the poet today scorns no movement in nature, and his mind pursues discovery just as much in the most vast and evasive syntheses: crowds, nebulae, oceans, nations, as in apparently simple facts: a hand which searches a pocket, a match which lights by scratching, the cries of animals, the odor of gardens after rain, a flame which is born on the hearth. Poets are not simply men devoted to the beautiful. They are also and especially devoted to truth, insofar as the unknown can be penetrated, so much that the unexpected, the surprising, is one of the principal sources of poetry today. And who would dare say that, for those who are worthy of joy, what is new is not beautiful? Others will soon busy themselves about discrediting this sublime novelty, after which it can enter the domain of reason, but only within those limits in which the poets, the sole dispensers of the true and the beautiful, have advanced it.\nThe poet, by the very nature of his explorations, is isolated in the new world into which he enters the first, and the only consolation which is left to him is that, since men must live in the end by truths in spite of the falsehoods with which they pad them, the poet alone sustains the life whereby humanity finds these truths. This is why modern poets are above all singers of a constantly new truth. And their task is infinite; they have surprised you and will surprise you again. They are already imagining schemes more profound than those which created with Machiavellian astuteness the useful and frightful symbol of money.\nThose who imagined the fable of Icarus, so marvellously realized today, will find others. They will carry you, living and awake, into a nocturnal world sealed with dreams. Into universes which tremble ineffably above our heads. Into those nearer and further universes which gravitate to the same point of infinity as what we carry within us. And more marvels than those which have been born since. the birth of the most ancient among us, will make the contemporary inventions of which we are so proud seem pale and childish.\nPoets will be charged finally with giving by means of lyric teleologies and arch-lyric alchemies a constantly purer meaning to the idea of divinity, which is so alive within us, which is perpetual renewal of ourselves, that eternal creation, that endless rebirth by which we live.\nAs far as we know, there are scarcely any poets today outside the French language.\nAll the other languages seem to keep silent so that the universe may hear the voices of the new French poets.\nThe entire world looks toward this light which alone illuminates the darkness which surrounds us.\nHere, however, these voices which are being raised scarcely make themselves heard.\nModern poets, creators, inventors, prophets; they ask that what they say be examined in the light of the greatest good of the group to which they belong. They turn toward Plato and beg him, if he would banish them from the Republic, at least to hear them first.\nFrance, the guardian of the whole secret of civilization, a secret only"}]}

And trampling underfoot our native sloth on opulent Persian carpets, we have been discussing right up to the limits of logic and scrawling the paper with demented writing. Our hearts were filled with an immense pride at feeling ourselves standing quite alone, like lighthouses or like the sentinels in an outpost, facing the army of enemy stars encamped in their celestial bivouacs. Alone with the engineers in the infernal stokeholes of great ships, alone with the black spirits which rage in the belly of rogue locomotives, alone with the drunkards beating their wings against the walls. Then we were suddenly distracted by the rumbling of huge double decker trams that went leaping by, streaked with light like the villages celebrating their festivals, which the Po in flood suddenly knocks down and uproots, and, in the rapids and eddies of a deluge, drags down to the sea. Then the silence increased. As we listened to the last faint prayer of the old canal and the crumbling of the bones of the moribund palaces with their green growth of beard, suddenly the hungry automobiles roared beneath our windows. `Come, my friends!' I said. `Let us go! At last Mythology and the mystic cult of the ideal have been left behind. We are going to be present at the birth of the centaur and we shall soon see the first angels fly! We must break down the gates of life to test the bolts and the padlocks! Let us go! Here is they very first sunrise on earth! Nothing equals the splendor of its red sword which strikes for the first time in our millennial darkness.' We went up to the three snorting machines to caress their breasts. I lay along mine like a corpse on its bier, but I suddenly revived again beneath the steering wheel - a guillotine knife - which threatened my stomach. A great sweep of madness brought us sharply back to ourselves and drove us through the streets, steep and deep, like dried up torrents. Here and there unhappy lamps in the windows taught us to despise our mathematical eyes. `Smell,' I exclaimed, `smell is good enough for wild beasts!' And we hunted, like young lions, death with its black fur dappled with pale crosses, who ran before us in the vast violet sky, palpable and living. And yet we had no ideal Mistress stretching her form up to the clouds, nor yet a cruel Queen to whom to offer our corpses twisted into the shape of Byzantine rings! No reason to die unless it is the desire to be rid of the too great weight of our courage! We drove on, crushing beneath our burning wheels, like shirt-collars under the iron, the watch dogs on the steps of the houses. Death, tamed, went in front of me at each corner offering me his hand nicely, and sometimes lay on the ground with a noise of creaking jaws giving me velvet glances from the bottom of puddles. `Let us leave good sense behind like a hideous husk and let us hurl ourselves, like fruit spiced with pride, into the immense mouth and breast of the world! Let us feed the unknown, not from despair, but simply to enrich the unfathomable reservoirs of the Absurd!' As soon as I had said these words, I turned sharply back on my tracks with the mad intoxication of puppies biting their tails, and suddenly there were two cyclists disapproving of me and tottering in front of me like two persuasive but contradictory reasons. Their stupid swaying got in my way. What a bore! Pouah! I stopped short, and in disgust hurled myself - vlan! - head over heels in a ditch. Oh, maternal ditch, half full of muddy water! A factory gutter! I savored a mouthful of strengthening muck which recalled the black teat of my Sudanese nurse! As I raised my body, mud-spattered and smelly, I felt the red hot poker of joy deliciously pierce my heart. A crowd of fishermen and gouty naturalists crowded terrified around this marvel. With patient and tentative care they raised high enormous grappling irons to fish up my car, like a vast shark that had run aground. It rose slowly leaving in the ditch, like scales, its heavy coachwork of good sense and its upholstery of comfort. We thought it was dead, my good shark, but I woke it with a single caress of its powerful back, and it was revived running as fast as it could on its fins. Then with my face covered in good factory mud, covered with metal scratches, useless sweat and celestial grime, amidst the complaint of staid fishermen and angry naturalists, we dictated our first will and testament to all the living men on earth. MANIFESTO OF FUTURISM 1. We want to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and rashness. 2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity and revolt. 3. Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and slumber. We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish sleeplessness, the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow with the fist. 4. We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace. 5. We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which crosses the earth, itself hurled along its orbit. 6. The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements. 7. Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man. 8. We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use of looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters of the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We are already living in the absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed. 9. We want to glorify war - the only cure for the world - militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas which kill, and contempt for woman. 10. We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice. 11. We will sing of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and revolt; the multi-colored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern capitals: the nocturnal vibration of the arsenals and the workshops beneath their violent electric moons: the gluttonous railway stations devouring smoking serpents; factories suspended from the clouds by the thread of their smoke; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across the diabolic cutlery of sunny rivers: adventurous steamers sniffing the horizon; great-breasted locomotives, puffing on the rails like enormous steel horses with long tubes for bridle, and the gliding flight of aeroplanes whose propeller sounds like the flapping of a flag and the applause of enthusiastic crowds. It is in Italy that we are issuing this manifesto of ruinous and incendiary violence, by which we today are founding Futurism, because we want to deliver Italy from its gangrene of professors, archaeologists, tourist guides and antiquaries. Italy has been too long the great second-hand market. We want to get rid of the innumerable museums which cover it with innumerable cemeteries. Museums, cemeteries! Truly identical in their sinister juxtaposition of bodies that do not know each other. Public dormitories where you sleep side by side for ever with beings you hate or do not know. Reciprocal ferocity of the painters and sculptors who murder each other in the same museum with blows of line and color. To make a visit once a year, as one goes to see the graves of our dead once a year, that we could allow! We can even imagine placing flowers once a year at the feet of the Gioconda! But to take our sadness, our fragile courage and our anxiety to the museum every day, that we cannot admit! Do you want to poison yourselves? Do you want to rot? What can you find in an old picture except the painful contortions of the artist trying to break uncrossable barriers which obstruct the full expression of his dream? To admire an old picture is to pour our sensibility into a funeral urn instead of casting it forward with violent spurts of creation and action. Do you want to waste the best part of your strength in a useless admiration of the past, from which you will emerge exhausted, diminished, trampled on? Indeed daily visits to museums, libraries and academies (those cemeteries of wasted effort, calvaries of crucified dreams, registers of false starts!) is for artists what prolonged supervision by the parents is for intelligent young men, drunk with their own talent and ambition. For the dying, for invalids and for prisoners it may be all right. It is, perhaps, some sort of balm for their wounds, the admirable past, at a moment when the future is denied them. But we will have none of it, we, the young, strong and living Futurists! Let the good incendiaries with charred fingers come! Here they are! Heap up the fire to the shelves of the libraries! Divert the canals to flood the cellars of the museums! Let the glorious canvases swim ashore! Take the picks and hammers! Undermine the foundation of venerable towns! The oldest among us are not yet thirty years old: we have therefore at least ten years to accomplish our task. When we are forty let younger and stronger men than we throw us in the waste paper basket like useless manuscripts! They will come against us from afar, leaping on the light cadence of their first poems, clutching the air with their predatory fingers and sniffing at the gates of the academies the good scent of our decaying spirits, already promised to the catacombs of the libraries. But we shall not be there. They will find us at last one winter's night in the depths of the country in a sad hangar echoing with the notes of the monotonous rain, crouched near our trembling aeroplanes, warming our hands at the wretched fire which our books of today will make when they flame gaily beneath the glittering flight of their pictures. They will crowd around us, panting with anguish and disappointment, and exasperated by our proud indefatigable courage, will hurl themselves forward to kill us, with all the more hatred as their hearts will be drunk with love and admiration for us. And strong healthy Injustice will shine radiantly from their eyes. For art can only be violence, cruelty, injustice. The oldest among us are not yet thirty, and yet we have already wasted treasures, treasures of strength, love, courage and keen will, hastily, deliriously, without thinking, with all our might, till we are out of breath. Look at us! We are not out of breath, our hearts are not in the least tired. For they are nourished by fire, hatred and speed! Does this surprise you? it is because you do not even remember being alive! Standing on the world's summit, we launch once more our challenge to the stars! Your objections? All right! I know them! Of course! We know just what our beautiful false intelligence affirms: `We are only the sum and the prolongation of our ancestors,' it says. Perhaps! All right! What does it matter? But we will not listen! Take care not to repeat those infamous words! Instead, lift up your head! Standing on the world's summit we launch once again our insolent challenge to the stars!"}]}

We declare that the triumphant progress of science has brought about changes in humanity so profound as to dig an abyss between the docile slaves of the past and us who are free, us who are confident in the shining splendor of the future. We are nauseated by the vile laziness which, from the sixteenth century on, has made our artists live by an incessant exploitation of ancient glories. In the eyes of other countries, Italy is still a land of the dead, an immense Pompeii of whitewashed sepulchers. But Italy must be reborn, and its political resurgence is being followed by an intellectual resurgence. In this land of illiterates, schools are being continually constructed: in this land of “dolce far niente,” innumerable factories are roaring; in this land of traditional aesthetics, today we see flights and lightning inspirations of newness that stand out. The only living art is that which finds its distinctive features within the environment that surrounds it. Just as our forebears took the subject of art from the religious atmosphere that enveloped them, so we must draw inspiration from the tangible miracles of contemporary life, from the iron network of speed which winds around the earth, from the transatlantic liners, the dreadnoughts, the marvelous flights that plow the skies, the shadowy audaciousness of submarine navigators, the spasmodic struggle to conquer the unknown. And how can we remain unresponsive to the frenzied activity of the great capitals, the ultra-recent psychology of noctambulism, the feverish figure of the  viveur,  the  cocotte,  the  apache,  and the alcoholic? Wanting to contribute to the necessary renovation of all artistic expression, we resolutely declare war on all those artists and institutions that, even when disguised with a false costume of modernity, remain trapped in tradition, academicism, and above all a repugnant mental laziness. We denounce as insulting to youth that entire irresponsible rabble of critics who in Rome applaud a nauseating reflowering of doting classicism; who in Florence praise the neurotic cultivators of a hermaphroditic archaism; who in Milan remunerate blind and pedestrian handicrafts going back to 1848; who in Turin adulate a painting made by retired bureaucrats; and who in Venice worship a woolly hodgepodge concocted by fossilized alchemists. In short, we rise up against the superficiality, banality, and handyman’s facility which render utterly contemptible the greater part of the artists currently  respected  in every region of Italy. So, down with mercenary restorers of antiquated incrustations! Down with archaeologists afflicted by chronic necrophilia! Down with critics, complacent pimps! Down with gouty academies and drunken and ignorant professors! Down! Go ahead and ask one of these priests of the true cult, these repositories of aesthetic laws, where can you find the works of Giovanni Segantini today? Why do the arts commissions ignore the work of Gaetano Previati? Where does anyone appreciate the sculpture of Medardo Rosso? . . . And who bothers to think about the artists who don’t already have twenty years of struggle and suffering to their credit, but who nevertheless are preparing works destined to honor our country? They have quite different interests to defend, the paid critics! Exhibitions, contests, and criticism that is superficial and never disinterested, these condemn Italian art to ignominy and a state of true prostitution! And what should we say about the  specialists  ? Let’s do it! Throw out the Portraitists, the Genre Painters, the Lake Painters, the Mountain Painters. We have put up with enough from them, all these impotent painters of country vacations. Down with the defacers of marble whose works clog up the piazzas and profane our graveyards. Down with speculative architecture of contractors in reinforced concrete. Down with hack decorators, ceramicists who make forgeries, sold-out poster painters, and shoddy, idiotic illustrators. Here are our final conclusions. With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we want: 1. To destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with antiquity, pedantry, and academic formalism. 2. To disdain utterly every form of imitation. 3. To exalt every form of originality, however daring, however violent. 4. To bear bravely and proudly the facile smear of “madness” with which innovators are whipped and gagged. 5. To regard all art critics as useless or harmful. 6. To rebel against the tyranny of words:  harmony and good taste,  those too loose expressions with which one could easily destroy the work of Rembrandt and Goya. 7. To sweep away from the ideal field of art all themes, all subjects that have been already used. 8. To render and glorify today’s life, incessantly and tumultuously transformed by victorious science. Let the dead stay buried in the deepest entrails of the earth! Let the threshold of the future be swept free of mummies! Make room for the young, the violent, the bold!"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the first manifesto that we launched on the 8th of March, 1910, from the stage of the Chiarella Theater in Turin, we expressed our deep-rooted disgust with, our proud contempt for, and our happy rebellion against vulgarity, mediocrity, the fanatical and snobbish worship of all that is old, attitudes which are suffocating Art in our Country. On that occasion we were concerned with the relations between ourselves and society. Today, instead, with this second manifesto, we are resolutely abandoning contingent considerations and rising instead to higher expressions of the pictorial absolute. Our growing desire for truth can no longer be satisfied with traditional Form and Color. The gesture that we want to reproduce will no longer be a  moment  in the universal dynamism  which has been stopped,  but the  dynamic sensation  itself, perpetuated as such. Indeed, all things move, all things run, all things are rapidly changing. A profile is never motionless before our eyes, but constantly appears and disappears. On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves, change shape, succeeding one another, like rapid vibrations, in the space which they traverse. Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular. All is conventional in art, and what was the truth for the painters of yesterday is only a falsehood for us today. We declare, for instance, that a portrait, in order to be a work of art, must not resemble the sitter, and that the painter carries in himself the landscapes which he would fix upon his canvas. To paint a human figure you must not paint it; you must render its surrounding atmosphere. Space no longer exists: a street pavement that has been soaked by rain beneath the glare of electric lamps can be an abyss gaping into the very center of the earth. The sun is thousands of miles away from us; yet the house in front of us can seem to fit into the solar disk. Who can still believe in the opacity of bodies, since our sharpened and multiplied sensibilities have already grasped the obscure manifestations of mediums? Why should we continue to create works that don’t take into account our growing visual powers which can yield results analogous to those of X rays? Countless examples positively sanction our claims. The sixteen people around you in a moving tram are in turn and at the same time one, ten, four, three; they are motionless and they change places; they are coming and going, they leap into the street, are suddenly swallowed up by a flood of sunlight, then come back and sit before you, persistent symbols of universal vibration. Or sometimes we look at the cheek of the person with whom we were talking in the street and can see the horse which is passing at the far corner. Again: Our bodies penetrate the sofas upon which we sit, and the sofas penetrate our bodies, just as the tram rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the tram and are merged with it. The construction of pictures has hitherto been stupidly traditional. Painters have shown us the objects and the people placed before us. We shall put the spectator in the center of the picture. Just as clear-sighted individual research has cast its light on the unchanging obscurities of dogma in every field of human thought, so in painting the vivifying current of individual freedom has to replace the academic tradition. We desperately want to reenter into life. Nowadays science has disowned its past in order the better to serve the material needs of our time; art, likewise disowning its past, must at last serve the intellectual needs of our time. Our renewed consciousness does not permit us to look upon man as the center of universal life. The suffering of a man is of the same interest to us as the suffering of an electric lamp, which can feel pain, suffer tremors, and shriek with the most heartrending expressions of torment. The music discernible in the lines and folds of modern clothing works upon our sensibilities with the same emotional and symbolic power as the nude once possessed for the old masters. In order to conceive and understand the new beauties of a modern picture, the soul must become pure; the eye must be freed from its veil of atavism and culture, so that it verifies its observations by recourse only to Nature, not to the Museum! Then, when that has been done, it will be admitted that brown tints have never coursed beneath our skin; it will be discovered our flesh is shining with yellow, that its red blazes, and that green, blue, and violet dance upon it with untold charms, voluptuous and caressing. How is it possible still to see the human face as pink, now that our life, redoubled by noctambulism, has multiplied our perceptions as colorists? The human face is yellow, red, green, blue, violet. The pallor of a woman gazing in a jeweler’s window is more iridescent than the glistening prisms of the jewels that fascinate her. The time has passed for our sensations in painting to be whispered. We will make them sing and shout on our canvases, which will sound forth deafening and triumphant flourishes. Your eyes, accustomed to semidarkness, will soon open to more radiant visions of light. The shadows that we shall paint will be more luminous than the highlights of our predecessors, and our pictures, next to those of the museums, will shine like blinding daylight compared with deepest night. This naturally leads us to conclude that painting cannot exist today without  divisionism.  This is not a technical  device  that can be methodically learned and applied at will. Divisionism, for the modern painter, must be an  innate complementariness, which we deem essential and necessary. In conclusion, we reject the charge that our art is too baroque. The ideas that we have explicated here derive wholly from our sharpened sensibility. While  baroque suggests artifice, overheated and yet feeble displays of virtuosity, Art as we foresee it is wholly derived from spontaneity and power. WE DECLARE: 1. That innate complementariness is an absolute necessity in painting, just as free meter in poetry or polyphony in music. 2. That universal dynamism must be rendered in painting as a dynamic sensation. 3. That in the manner of rendering Nature the first essential is sincerity and purity. 4. That movement and light destroy the materiality of bodies. WE FIGHT: 1. Against the false patinas and varnishing by which it is attempted to give modern paintings the aura of older pictures.  67 Against Passéist Venice 2. Against the superficial and elementary archaism founded upon flat tints, which reduces a painting to a powerless synthesis, both childish and grotesque. 3. Against the false claims to belong to the future put forward by the secessionists and the independents, the new academics now to be found in every country. 4. Against the nude in painting, as nauseous and as tedious as adultery in literature. You think that we are mad. Instead, we are the Primitives of a new sensibility that has been utterly transformed. Beyond and outside the atmosphere in which we alone live, there is nothing but shadows. We Futurists are ascending to the highest and most radiant summits, and we proclaim ourselves the Lords of Light, for already we are drinking from the quickening sources of the Sun."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "THE FUTURIST SENSIBILITY \n\nMy “Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature” (11 May 1912), in which I first invented synthetic and essential lyricism, wireless imagination, and words-in-freedom, is concerned exclusively with poetic inspiration. Philosophy, the exact sciences, politics, journalism, education, business, however much they may seek synthetic forms of expression, will still have to make use of syntax and punctuation. Indeed, I myself have to make use of them in order to advance the exposition of my concepts. Futurism is based on the complete renewal of human sensibility that has occurred as an effect of science’s major discoveries. Those people who today make use of the telegraph, the telephone, the gramophone, the train, the bicycle, the motorcycle, the automobile, the ocean liner, the dirigible, the airplane, the cinema, the great newspaper (the synthesis of a day in the world’s life) are not aware of the decisive influence that these various forms of communication, transportation, and information have on their psyches. An ordinary man, spending a day’s time in the train, can be transported from a small town, dead, with empty squares in which the sun, the dust, and the wind divert each other in silence, to a great capital bristling with lights, movement, and street cries. By means of the newspaper, the inhabitant of a mountain village can tremble with anxiety every day, following the Chinese in revolt, the suffragettes of London or New York, Doctor Carrel, or the heroic dogsleds of the polar explorers. The pusillanimous and sedentary inhabitant of any provincial town can allow him- self the inebriation of danger by going to the movies and watching a great hunt in the Congo. He can admire Japanese athletes, Negro boxers, endless American eccentrics, and very elegant Parisian women by spending a franc to go to the variety theater. Then, tucked up in his bourgeois bed, he can enjoy the distant and costly voice of a Caruso or a Burzio. Having becoming commonplace, such possibilities fail to arouse the curiosity of superficial minds which remain as incapable of grasping their deeper significance as the Arabs who watched with indifference the first airplanes in the skies above Tripoli. Yet to an acute observer these possibilities are so many modifiers of our sensibility, because they have caused the following significant phenomena: 1. Acceleration of life, which today has a rapid rhythm. Physical, intellectual, and emotional equilibrium on the cord of velocity stretched between contradictory magnetisms. Multiple and simultaneous states of mind within the same individual. 2. Dread of whatever is old and already known. Love of the new, the unexpected. 3. Dread of quiet living, love of danger and an attitude of daily heroism. 4. Destruction of a sense of the beyond and increased value assigned to the individual who wants to vivre sa vie, to use the phrase of Bonnot. 5. Human desires and ambitions multiplying and going beyond all limits. 6. An exact knowledge of everything inaccessible and unrealizable in each person. 7. Semi-equality of man and woman, and less inequality in their social rights. 8. Contempt for love (sentimentalism or lechery) produced by greater freedom and erotic ease among women and by universal exaggeration of female luxury. Let me explain: today’s women love luxury more than love. A visit to a great dressmaker’s shop, escorted by a banker friend who is paunchy and gouty but will pay the bill, has taken the place of some hot rendezvous with an adored young man. The element of mystery once found in love now resides in the selection of an amazing outfit, latest model, preferably one which her friends don’t yet have. Men no longer love a woman who is without luxus. The lover has lost all prestige, and Love has lost its absolute value. A complex question, one which I can only touch in passing. 9. Modification of patriotism, which nowadays has become the heroic idealization of a people’s commercial, industrial, and artistic solidarity. 10. Modification of the conception of war, which has become the sanguinary and necessary test of the strength of a people. 11. The passion, art, idealism of Business. New financial sensibility. 12. Man multiplied by the machine. New mechanical sense, a fusion of instinct with the output of a motor and forces that have been mastered. 13. The passion, art, and idealism of Sport. Idea and love of “the record.” 14. The new tourist sensibility of ocean liners and grand hotels (annual synthesis of various races). Passion for the city. Negation of distances and solitary nostalgia. Derision for “silence green and sacred” and the ineffable landscape. 15. The earth shrunk by speed. New sense of the world. Let me explain: men have successively conquered a sense of the house, the neighborhood in which they live, the city, the region, the continent. Today man possesses a sense of the world; he has only a modest need to know what his forebears have done, but a burning need to know what his contemporaries are doing in every part of the globe. Whence the necessity, for the individual, of communicating with all the peoples of the earth. Whence the need to feel oneself at the center, to be judge and motor of the infinite both explored and unexplored. A gigantic increase in the sense of humanity and an urgent need to coordinate at every moment our relations with all humanity. 16. Disgust for the curving line, the spiral, and the tourniquet. Love for the straight line and the tunnel. The habit of foreshortened views and visual syntheses created by the speed of trains and automobiles which look down over cities and country landscapes. Dread of slowness, minutiae, detailed analyses, and explanations. Love of speed, abbreviation, and synopsis. “Quick, tell me the whole story in two words.” 17. Love of depth and essence in every mental activity. So these are some of the elements of a new Futurist sensibility which have generated our pictorial dynamism, our antigraceful music devoid of steady continuous rhythm, our Art of noises and Futurist words-in-freedom.  \n\nWORDS-IN-FREEDOM Casting aside all stupid definitions and confusing professorial verbalisms, I declare that lyricism is the rarely found faculty of intoxicating oneself with life and with oneself. The faculty of changing into wine the muddy waters of the life that surround us and flow through us. The faculty of coloring the world with the unique colors of our changeable “I.” Now imagine that a friend of yours, gifted with this kind of lyrical faculty, should find himself in a zone of intense life (revolution, war, shipwreck, earthquake, etc.), and should come, immediately afterward, to recount his impressions. Do you know what your lyrical friend will do while he is still shocked? . . . He will begin by brutally destroying the syntax of his speech. He will not waste time in constructing periodic sentences. He could care less about punctuation or finding the right adjective. He disdains subtleties and shadings, and in haste he will assault your nerves with visual, auditory, olfactory sensations, just as their insistent pressure in him demands. The rush of steam-emotion will burst the steampipe of the sentence, the valves of punctuation, and the regular clamp of the adjective. Fistfuls of basic words without any conventional order. The narrator’s only preoccupation: to render all the vibrations of his “I.”  Moreover, if this same narrator gifted with lyricism has a mind stocked with general ideas, he will involuntarily link his sensations to the entire universe as he has known and intuited it. And in order to render the exact weight and proportion of the life he has experienced, he will hurl immense networks of analogies across the world. And thus he will render the analogical ground of life, telegraphically, which is to say with the same economical rapidity that the telegraph imposes on war correspondents and journalists for their synoptic accounts. This need for laconicism not only responds to the laws of velocity that regulate us today, but also the age-old relations that the public and the poet have had. For between the poet and the public, in fact, the same kind of relations exist as between two old friends. They can speak to each other with a half-word, a gesture, a wink. That is why the imagination of the poet must weave together distant things without connecting wires, by means of essential words in freedom.  \n\nDEATH OF FREE VERSE \nFree verse once had countless regions for existing, but it is now destined to be replaced by words-in-freedom. The evolution of poetry and human sensibility have shown us the two irremediable defects of free verse. 1. Free verse fatally impels the poet toward facile effects of sonorousness, predictable mirror-games, monotonous cadences, absurd chiming, and inescapable echo-play, internal and external. 2. Free verse artificially channels the current of lyrical emotion between the banks of syntax and the weirs of grammar. The free intuitive inspiration that directly addresses the intuition of the ideal reader finds itself imprisoned, or redistributed into so many glasses of purified water for the alimentation of restless, fussy minds. When I speak of destroying the canals of syntax, I am being neither peremptory nor systematic. In the words-in-freedom of my unchained lyricism, there will still be traces here and there of regular syntax and even of true, logical periods. This inequality in concision and freedom is inevitable and natural. Since poetry, in reality, is nothing more than a superior form of life, more concentrated and intense than the one we lead everyday,—it too is composed of elements that are hyperalive and moribund. We need not, therefore, worry too much over the latter. But at all costs we must avoid rhetoric and commonplaces expressed telegraphically.    \n\nTHE WIRELESS IMAGINATION \nBy wireless imagination, I mean the absolute freedom of images or analogies, expressed with disconnected words, and without the connecting syntactical wires and without punctuation. Until now writers have been restricted to immediate analogies. For example, they have compared an animal to man or to another animal, which is more or less the same thing as taking a photograph. (They’ve compared, for example, a fox terrier to a tiny thoroughbred. A more advanced writer might compare that same trembling terrier to a telegraph. I, instead, compare it to gurgling water. In this there is an ever greater gradation of analogies, affinities ever deeper and more solid, however remote.) Analogy is nothing other than the deep love that binds together remote, seemingly diverse or inimical. The life of matter can be embraced only by an orchestral style, at once polychromatic, polyphonic, and polymorphous, by means of the most extensive analogies. In my Battle of Tripoli, when I have compared a trench bristling with bayonets to an orchestra, or a machine-gun to a femme fatale, I have intuitively introduced a large part of the universe into a brief episode of African combat. Images are not flowers to be chosen and gathered with parsimony, as Voltaire said. They constitute the very lifeblood of poetry. Poetry should be an uninterrupted flow of new images, without which it is merely anemia and green-sickness. The vaster their affinities, the more images will retain their power to astound. (“Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature”) Wireless imagination and words-in-freedom will transport us into the essence of matter. With the discovery of new analogies between things remote and apparently contradictory, we shall value them ever more intimately. Instead of humanizing animals, vegetables, and minerals (a bygone system) we will be able to animalize, vegetize, mineralize, electrify, or liquefy our style, making it live the very life of matter. For example, to render the life of a blade of grass, we might say: “I will be greener tomorrow.” But with words-in-freedom we might have: Condensed Metaphors. —Telegraphic images. —Sums of vibrations. —Knots of thought. —Closed or open fans of movement. —Foreshortened analogies. —Color Balances. —The dimensions, weights, sizes, and velocities of sensations. —The plunge of the essential word into the water of sensibility, without the concentric eddies produced by words. —Intuition’s moments of repose. —Movements in two, three, four, five different rhythms. —Analytical explanatory telegraph poles that sustain the cable of intuitive wires. \n\nDEATH OF THE LITERARY “I” \nMatter and Molecular Life \nMy “Technical Manifesto” inveighed against the obsession with the “I” that poets have described, sung, analyzed, and vomited forth until today. To rid ourselves of this obsessive “I,” we must abandon the habit of humanizing nature, attributing human preoccupations and emotions to animals, plants, waters, stones, and clouds. Instead we should express the infinite smallness that surrounds us, the imperceptible, the invisible, the agitation of atoms, Brownian movements, all the thrilling hypotheses and all the dominions explored by high-powered microscopes. Let me explain: I want to introduce infinite molecular life into poetry not as a scientific document, but as an intuitive element. It should be mixed in with art works, with spectacles and dramas of what is infinitely grand, since the fusion of both constitutes the integral synthesis of life. To help a bit the intuition of my ideal reader, I use italics for words-in-freedom that express infinite smallness and molecular life. \n\nSEMAPHORIC ADJECTIVE \nAdjective-Lighthouse or Atmosphere-adjective Everywhere we tend to suppress a qualifying adjective, since it presupposes a halt in intuition, an overly minute definition of the noun. That is not a categorical prohibition, but a tendency. What is necessary is to use the adjective as little as possible and to do so in a manner absolutely different from that which has prevailed until now. The adjective should be viewed as a railroad signal or a semaphore of style, serving to regulate the impetus, the slowing and pausing of advancing analogies. As many as twenty of these semaphoric adjectives might be accumulated in this way. What I call a semaphoric adjective, adjective-lighthouse, or atmosphere adjective is an adjective separated from its noun and instead isolated in parentheses, which turns it into a sort of absolute noun, vaster and more powerful than a noun proper. The semaphoric adjective or adjective-lighthouse, suspended above the ground in the glassy cage of parentheses, casts its whirling light into the distance all around. The profile of this adjective crumbles, spreads abroad, illuminating, impregnating, and enveloping a whole zone of words-in-freedom. For example, I might place the following adjectives between parenthesis amid a group of words-in-freedom describing a voyage by sea: (calm blue methodical habitual). It would not be just the sea that is calm blue methodical habitual, but the ship, its machinery, the passengers, whatever I might be doing, and my very mind. \n\nTHE VERB IN THE INFINITIVE \nHere, too, my pronouncements are not categorical. I maintain, however, that the verb in the infinitive is indispensable to a violent and dynamic lyricism, for the infinitive is round like a wheel, and like a wheel it is adaptable to all the railroad cars that make up the train of analogies, so constituting the very speed of style. The verb in the infinitive denies by its very existence the classical period and prevents the style from slowing or sitting down at any specific point. While the verb in the infinitive is round and mobile as a wheel, the other moods and tenses of the verb are triangular, square, or oval. \n\nONOMATOPOEIA AND MATHEMATICAL SIGNS \n\nWhen I said, “Every day we must spit on the Altar of Art,” I was inciting Futurists to liberate lyricism from the solemn atmosphere of compunction and incense that one usually calls Art with a capital A. Art with a capital A is a form of intellectual clericalism. That is why I incited Futurists to destroy and mock the garlands, palms, aureoles, exquisite frames, mantles, and stoles, the whole historical wardrobe of romantic bric-a-brac that has comprised so much of all poetry until now. I urged instead a swift, brutal, and immediate lyricism, one that would appear to all our predecessors as antipoetic, a telegraphic lyricism that would have nothing of the bookish about it, but as much as possible of the flavor of life. Whence the bold introduction of onomatopoetic harmonies to render all the sounds and noises of modern life, even the most cacophonous. Onomatopoeia, which can help to vivify lyricism with raw and brutal elements of reality, has been used (from Aristophanes to Pascoli) rather timidly in poetry. But we Futurists call for an audacious and ongoing use of onomatopoeia. It need not be systematic. For example, my “Adrianople Siege—Orchestra” and my “Battle Weight + Smell” required many onomatopoetic harmonies. Always for the purpose of rendering a maximum quantity of vibrations and a deeper synthesis of life, we abolish all stylistic connectors, all the shiny buckles with which traditional poets have linked images to the period. Instead we employ very brief or anonymous mathematical and musical signs, and between parentheses we place indications such as (fast) (faster) (slower) (two-beat time) to control the speed of the style. These parentheses can even cut into a word or an onomatopoetic harmony. \n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL REVOLUTION \nI have initiated a typographical revolution directed against the bestial, nauseating sort of book that contains passéist poetry or verse à la D’Annunzio—handmade paper that imitates models of the seventeenth century, festooned with helmets, Minervas, Apollos, decorative capitals in red ink with loops and squiggles, vegetables, mythological ribbons from missals, epigraphs, and Roman numerals. The book must be the Futurist expression of Futurist thought. Not only that. My revolution is directed against the so-called typographical harmony of the page, which is contrary to the flux and reflux, the leaps and bursts of style that run through the page itself. For that reason we will use, in the very same page, three or four different colors of ink, and as many as twenty different typographical fonts if necessary. For example: italics for a series of swift or similar sensations, boldface for violent onomatopoeias, etc. The typographical revolution and the multicolored variety in the letters will mean that I can double the expressive force of words. I oppose the decorative and precious aesthetic of Mallarmé and his search for the exotic word, the unique and irreplaceable, elegant, suggestive, exquisite adjective. I have no wish to suggest an idea of sensation by means of passéist graces and affectations: I want to seize them brutally and fling them in the reader’s face. I also oppose Mallarmé’s static ideal. The typographic revolution that I’ve proposed will enable me to imprint words (words already free, dynamic, torpedoing forward) every velocity of the stars, clouds, airplanes, trains, waves, explosives, drops of seafoam, molecules, and atoms. And so I shall realize the fourth principle contained in my “First Manifesto of Futurism” (20 February 1909): “We affirm that the beauty of the world has been enriched by a new form of beauty: the beauty of speed.” \n\nMULTILINEAL LYRICISM \nIn addition, I have also devised multilineal lyricism, with which I am able to obtain that lyrical simultaneity which has obsessed Futurist painters, and by means of which I am convinced that we can achieve the most complex lyrical simultaneities. On several parallel lines, a poet will launch several chains of colors, sounds, odors, noises, weights, densities, analogies. One line, for example, might be olfactory, another musical, another pictorial. Let us imagine that one chain of sensations and pictorial analogies dominates several other chains of sensations and analogies: in that case it will be printed in a heavier typeface than the one used in the second or third lines (the one containing, for example, a chain of sensations and musical analogies; the other, a chain of sensations and olfactory analogies). Given a page containing many groups of sensations and analogies, with each group composed of, say, three or four lines, then the first line of each group might be formed of pictorial sensations and analogies (printed in heavier typeface) and the same sort of chain would continue (always in heavier typeface) in the first line of each of the other groups. The chain of musical sensations and analogies (second line), though less important than visual sensations and analogies (first line), yet more important than the olfactory sensations and analogies (third line), might be printed in a typeface lighter than that of the first line, but heavier than that of the third. \n\nFREE EXPRESSIVE ORTHOGRAPHY \nThe historical necessity of free expressive orthography is demonstrated by the successive revolutions that have continuously freed the lyrical powers of the human race from shackles and rules. 1. Poets, in fact, began by channeling their lyric intoxication in a series of equal breaths, with accents, echoes, assonances, or rhymes at preestablished intervals (traditional metrics), then varied these different breaths, measured by the lungs of preceding poets, with a certain freedom. 2. Later, poets came to feel that differing moments of their lyrical intoxication required commensurate breath of various and unexpected lengths, with absolute freedom of accentuation. Thus they arrived at free verse, yet still preserved the syntactic order of words so that their lyrical intoxication could flow down to the listeners by the logical channel of syntax. 3. Today we no longer want lyrical intoxication to order words in syntactic order before launching them forth with the breaths that we have invented, and hence we have words-in-freedom. Further, our lyrical intoxication must be free to deform and reshape words, cutting them, lengthening them, reinforcing their centers or their extremities, increasing or diminishing the number of vowels and consonants. Thus we will have the new orthography which I call free expressive. This instinctive deformation of words corresponds to our natural tendency to use onomatopoeia. It matters little if a word, having been deformed, becomes ambiguous. For it will be wedded with onomatopoetic harmonies, synopses of noises, and these will enable us to swiftly reach an onomatopoetic psychic harmony, the sonorous but abstract expression of an emotion of pure thought. It may be objected that words-in-freedom or the wireless imagination require a special declamation, or else they will remain incomprehensible. Though I am not greatly worried about being understood by the masses, I will reply by noting that Futurist declaimers are rapidly increasing and further, that any greatly admired traditional poem has also required a special declamation in order to be fully savored."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dear Balilla Pratella, great Futurist composer, At the crowded Costanzi Theater in Rome, while I was listening to the orchestral performance of your overwhelming Futurist music, together with my Futurist friends Marinetti, Boccioni, Carrà, Balla, Soffici, Papini, and Cavacchioli, there came to my mind the idea of a new art, one that only you can create: the Art of Noises, a logical consequence of your marvelous innovations. In older times life was completely silent. In the nineteenth century, with the invention of machines, Noise was born. Today, Noise is triumphant and reigns supreme over the sensibility of men. For many centuries life went by in silence, or at most with muted sound. The loudest noises that interrupted this silence were neither intense, extended, nor varied. For if we set aside exceptional movements across the earth’s surface, such as hurricanes, storms, avalanches, and waterfalls, nature is silent. Amidst this scarcity of noises, the first sounds that men were able to extract from a hollow reed or a taut string were stupefying, something new and marvelous. Primitive peoples ascribed sound to the gods, deemed it sacred, and reserved it to priests, who used it to enrich their rites with mystery. Thus was born the concept of sound as a thing it itself, distinct from life and independent of it, and from that resulted music, a fantastic world superimposed on the real one, an inviolable and sacred world. It is easy to understand how such a concept of music must have inevitably hindered its progress in comparison with the other arts. The Greeks themselves, adopting a musical theory which was mathematically systematized by Pythagoras and which permitted only a few consonant intervals, limited the field of music considerably and rendered harmony, of which they remained ignorant, impossible. The Middle Ages, with developments and modifications of the Greek tetrachord system, with Gregorian chants and popular songs, enriched the art of music, but continued to consider sound only in its unfolding in time, a restricted concept that lasted for several centuries and can still be found in the extremely complicated polyphonies of Flemish contrapuntists. The chord did not exist; development of the different parts was not subordinated to the chord that these parts produced in their ensemble; and the conception of these parts was horizontal, not vertical. The desire, the search, and the taste for a simultaneous union of different sounds, i.e. for the chord (complex sound), arose only gradually, passing from perfect consonance with a few incidental dissonances to the complicated and persistent dissonances which characterize contemporary music. At first the art of music sought and achieved purity, limpidity, and sweetness of sound; later it incorporated more diverse sounds, though it still took care to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today, growing ever more complicated, it is seeking those combinations of sounds that fall most dissonantly, strangely, and harshly on the ear. We are drawing ever closer to noise-sound. This evolution of music is parallel to the multiplication of machines, which everywhere are collaborating with man. Not only amid the clamor of the metropolis, but also in the countryside, which until yesterday was normally silent, in our time the machine has created such a variety and such combinations of noises that pure sound, in its slightness and monotony, no longer arouses any feeling. To excite and exalt our sensibilities, music has been developing toward extremely complex polyphony and the greatest possible variety of orchestral timbres, or colors, seeking out the most complex successions of dissonant chords, and preparing in a general way for the creation of musical noise. This evolution toward “noise-sound” was not possible before now. The ear of an eighteenth-century man could never have supported the dissonant intensity of certain chords produced by our orchestras (with three times as many performers as those of his day). Our ear instead takes pleasure in it, since it has already been trained by modern life, so teeming in different noises. Not, however, that it is fully satisfied: instead it demands an ever greater range of acoustical emotions. Musical sound, on the other hand, is too limited in its qualitative variety of timbres. The most complicated orchestras are reduced to four or five classes of instruments, differing in timbre: instruments played with the bow, plucked instruments, brass winds, wood winds, and percussion instruments. So that modern music founders within this tiny circle as it vainly attempts to create new kinds of timbre. We must break out of this restricted circle of pure sounds and conquer the infinite variety of noise-sounds. Further, everyone will recognize that every sound carries with it a cluster of already familiar and stale associations which predispose the hearer to boredom, despite all the efforts of innovative musicians. We Futurists have all deeply loved and enjoyed the harmonies of the great masters. Beethoven and Wagner have stirred our hearts and nerves for many years. But now we are satiated with them, and we derive far more pleasure from ideally combining the noises of trams, internalcombustion engines, carriages, and noisy crowds than from rehearing, for example, the “Eroica” or the “Pastorale.” 3 We can hardly observe that enormous apparatus of forces represented by the modern orchestra without feeling the deepest disappointment at its petty acoustic achievements. Is anything more ridiculous than the sight of twenty men furiously bent on redoubling the meowing of a violin? Naturally all this will make the musico-maniacs scream and perhaps disturb the somnolent atmosphere of our concert-halls. But let us go together, as Futurists, into one of these hospitals for anaemic sounds. Listen to it: the first bar wafts to your ear the boredom of the already-heard and gives you a foretaste of the boredom to follow in the next. Let us savor, from one bar to the next, two or three species of pure boredom, forever waiting for the extraordinary sensation that never comes. Meanwhile, one is struck by that repugnant mixture which is created by emotional monotony and the cretinous religious excitement of the listeners, Bhuddhistically intoxicated by the thousandth repetition of their spurious and snobbish ecstasy. Away! Let’s be gone, since it won’t be long before we can’t restrain our desire to create at least one new musical reality by generously handing out sonorous slaps, stamping with both feat on violins, pianos, contrabasses, and groaning organs. Away! It’s no good objecting that noise is simply loud and disagreeable to the ear. It seems to me pointless to enumerate all the graceful and delicate noises that afford pleasant acoustic sensations. To be convinced of their astonishing variety one need only think of the rumbling of thunder, the whistling of the wind, the roaring of a waterfall, the gurgling of a brook, the rustling of leaves, the clatter of a horse trotting into the distance, the rattling jolt of a cart over cobblestones, or the deep, solemn, and white breath of a city at night, or all the noises made by wild and domestic animals, or all those that can be made by the mouth of man, apart from speech or song. Let us wander through a great modern city with our ears more alert than our eyes and we shall find pleasure in distinguishing the rushing of water, gas, or air in metal pipes, the purring of motors that breathe and pulsate with indisputable animality, the throbbing of valves, the pounding of pistons, the screeching of mechanical saws, the jolting of trams on their tracks, the cracking of whips, the flapping of curtains and flags. We shall amuse ourselves by creating mental orchestrations of the crashing down of metal shop shutters, the slamming of doors, the bustle and shuffling of crowds, the varied racket of railroad stations, iron foundries, spinning mills, printing plants, subways, and electrical power stations. Nor should the latest noises of modern warfare be forgotten. Recently the poet Marinetti, in a letter written from the Bulgarian trenches surrounding Adrianople, described for me the orchestration of a large battle, rendered in marvelous wordsin-freedom: every 5 seconds siege-cannons to disembowel space with a chord Bam-Booooomb mutiny of 500 echoes in order to snap to break up to scatter to the infinite In the middle of those smashed Bam-Booombs range 50 square kilometers to bounce sweepings cuttings fists batteries in rapid fire Violence fierceness regularity this low weighty surging the strange madmen agitated taut from the battle Fury torment ears eyes nostrils open! straining! force!

Giving pitches to noises doesn’t mean depriving them of all the irregularity of tempo and intensity that characterize their movements and vibrations, but giving gradation or pitch to the strongest and predominant vibrations. Indeed, noise differs from sound only insofar as the vibrations that produce it are irregular and confused, both in tempo and intensity. Every noise has a note, sometimes even a chord, that predominates in the ensemble of irregular vibrations. Now, because of the predominating characteristic note, it is possible to “attune” it, or to assign a certain noise not just a single pitch but a variety of pitches, without losing its characteristic quality, but which I mean its timbre. Thus certain noises produced by rotary motion can offer an entire ascending or descending chromatic scale if the speed of the motion is increased or decreased. Every manifestation of life is accompanied by noise. Noise is therefore familiar to our ears and has the power of immediately reminding us of life itself. But sound is alien to life, is always musical and a thing unto itself, an occasional and not an essential element, and it has become for our ears what a too familiar face is to our eyes. Noise, instead, comes to us in a confused and irregular way from the irregular confusion of life; it never reveals itself entirely to us and keeps innumerable surprises in reserve. We are convinced that by selecting, coordinating, and controlling noises we shall enrich mankind with a new and unexpected pleasure of the senses. Even though it is characteristic of noise to remind us brutally of life, the art of noises must not be limited to an imitative reproduction. It will achieve its greatest emotional power in acoustic pleasure in itself, which the artist’s inspiration will evoke from combined noises. These are the 6 families of noises in the Futurist orchestra, noises which we shall soon produce mechanically: \n1 Rumbles Thundering Explosions Crashes Splashes Booms \n2 Whistles Hisses Snorts \n3 Whispers Murmurs Mutters Buzzes Gurgles Scuffles, etc. \n4 Screeches Creaking Rustles Throbs Crackles Scuffles \n5 Noises made by percussion on metals, woods, skins, stones, terracotta \n6 Voices of animals and people: Shouts, Screams, Groans, Howls, Wails, Laughs, Wheezes, Sobs\n\nIn this we have included the most characteristic of the fundamental noises; the others are simply associations and combinations of these. The rhythmic movements of a noise are infinite. There is always, as with a note, a predominant rhythm, but around this there are many other secondary rhythms that can be perceived. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n1. Futurist musicians must constantly enlarge and enrich the field of sound. This responds to a need in our sensibility. Indeed, we note that the most talented composers of today are tending to adopt the most complicated dissonances. As they move ever farther away from pure sound, they almost achieve noise-sound. This need and this tendency can be satisfied only by adding and substituting noises for sounds. \n2. Futurist musicians must replace the limited variety of timbres offered by contemporary orchestral instruments with the infinite variety of the timbres of noises, reproduced by suitable mechanisms. \n3. The sensibility of the musician, liberated from facile and traditional rhythm, must find the way to enhance and renew itself in noises, for every noise offers a union of the most diverse rhythms, aside from its predominant one. \n4. Since every noise has a general predominating tone among its irregular vibrations, a sufficiently wide variety of tones, semitones, and quarter-tones will be easily attained in constructing the instruments that imitate it. \n5. The practical difficulties facing the construction of these instruments are not serious. Once the mechanical principle for producing a certain noise has been found, its pitch can be varied applying the general laws of acoustics. If the instrument has a rotary movement, for example, its speed will be increased or decreased; if it doesn’t have a rotary movement, the size or tension of the parts will be varied. \n6. It will not be through a succession of noises imitating those of life, but through a fantastic combination of the various timbres and rhythms that the new orchestra will achieve the newest and most complicated aural emotions. For that purpose every instrument will have to offer the possibility of varying its pitch, or will need a more or less extended range. \n7. The variety of noises is infinite. If today when we have perhaps a thousand different machines, we can distinguish a thousand different noises, then tomorrow, as new machines multiply we shall be able to distinguish ten, twenty, or thirty thousand different noises, not merely to be imitated, but to be combined as imagination dictates. \n8. We therefore invite young musicians of talent and audacity to listen continually and carefully to all noises in order to understand the various rhythms that go into their making, their principal tone, and their secondary ones. Then, by comparing their various timbres with those of sounds, they’ll be persuaded how much more numerous are the former than the latter. This will not only give us an understanding of noises, but also a taste and a passion for them. Our multiplied sensibility, having already been conquered by the eyes of the Futurists, will at last have Futurist ears. In this way the motors and the machines of our industrial cities will one day be able to be consciously attuned, so that every factory will be made into an intoxicating orchestra of noises. \n\nDear Pratella, I submit these propositions to your Futurist genius and invite you to discuss them with me. I am not a musician, and therefore I don’t have acoustical predilections or works that I have to defend. I am a Futurist painter who is using a much loved to art to project my determination to renew everything. Which is why, more daring than any professional musician could be, not worrying myself about my apparent incompetence and convinced that boldness possesses all rights and seizes all possibilities, I have been able to intuit the great renovation of music through the Art of noises."}]}

I don't want words that other people have invented. All the words are other people's inventions. I want my own stuff, my own rhythm, and vowels and consonants too, matching the rhythm and all my own. If this pulsation is seven yards long, I want words for it that are seven yards long. Mr Schulz's words are only two and a half centimetres long. It will serve to show how articulated language comes into being. I let the vowels fool around. I let the vowels quite simply occur, as a cat meows . . . Words emerge, shoulders of words, legs, arms, hands of words. Au, oi, uh. One shouldn't let too many words out. A line of poetry is a chance to get rid of all the filth that clings to this accursed language, as if put there by stockbrokers' hands, hands worn smooth by coins. I want the word where it ends and begins. Dada is the heart of words. Each thing has its word, but the word has become a thing by itself. Why shouldn't I find it? Why can't a tree be called Pluplusch, and Pluplubasch when it has been raining? The word, the word, the word outside your domain, your stuffiness, this laughable impotence, your stupendous smugness, outside all the parrotry of your self-evident limitedness. The word, gentlemen, is a public concern of the first importance."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The magic of a word / DADA / which for journalists has opened the door to an unforeseen world, has for us not the slightest importance. To launch a manifesto you have to want: A.B. & C., and fulminate against 1, 2, & 3, work yourself up and sharpen you wings to conquer and circulate lower and upper case As, Bs & Cs, sign, shout, swear, organise prose into a form that is absolutely and irrefutably obvious, prove its ne plus ultra and maintain that novelty resembles life in the same way as the latest apparition of a harlot proves the essence of God. His existence had already been proved by the accordion, the landscape and soft words. * To impose one's A.B.C. is only natural / and therefore regrettable. Everyone does it in the form of a crystalbluff/madonna, or a monetary system, or pharmaceutical preparations, a naked leg being the invitation to an ardent and sterile Spring. The love of novelty is a pleasant sort of cross, it's evidence of a naive don't/give/a/damn attitude, a passing, positive, sign without rhyme or reason. But this need is out of date, too. By giving art the impetus of supreme simplicity / novelty / we are being human and true in relation to innocent pleasures; impulsive and vibrant in order to crucify boredom. At the lighted crossroads, alert, attentive, lying in wait for years, in the forest. * I am writing a manifesto and there's nothing I want, and yet I'm saying certain things, and in principle I am against manifestos, as I am against principles (quantifying measures of the moral value of every phrase / too easy; approximation was invested by the impressionists). * I'm writing this manifesto to show that you can perform contrary actions at the same time, in one single, fresh breath; I am against action; as for continual contradiction, and affirmation too, I am neither for nor against them, and I won't explain myself because I hate common sense. DADA / this is a word that throws up ideas so that they can be shot down; every bourgeois is a little playwright, who invents different subjects and who, instead of situating suitable characters on the level of his own intelligence, like chrysalises on chairs, tries to find causes or objects (according to whichever psychoanalytic method he practices) to give weight to his plot, a talking and self/defining story. * Every spectator is a plotter, if he tries to explain a word (to know!) From his padded refuge of serpentine complications, he allows his instincts to be manipulated. Whence the sorrows of conjugal life. To be plain: The amusement of redbellies in the mills of empty skulls.     DADA DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING If we consider it futile, and if we don't waste our time over a word that doesn't mean anything... The first thought that comes to these minds is of a bacteriological order: at least to discover its etymological, historical or psychological meaning. We read in the papers that the negroes of the Kroo race call the tail of a sacred cow: DADA. A cube, and a mother, in a certain region of Italy, are called: DADA. The word for a hobby horse, a children's nurse, a double affirmative in Russian and Romanian, is also: DADA. Some learned journalists see it as an art for babies, other Jesuscallingthelittlechildrenuntohim saints see it as a return to an unemotional and noisy primitivism / noise and monotonous. A sensitivity cannot be built on the basis of a word; every sort of construction converges into a boring sort of perfection, a stagnant idea of a golden shop now g format tray swamp, a relative human product. A work of art shouldn't be beauty per se, because it is dead; neither gay nor sad, neither light nor dark; it is to rejoice or maltreat individualities to serve them up the cakes of sainted haloes or the sweat of a meandering chase through the atmosphere. A work of art is never beautiful, by decree, objectively, for everyone. Criticism is, therefore, useless; it only exists subjectively, for every individual, and without the slightest general characteristic. Do people imagine they have found the psychic basis common to all humanity? The attempt of Jesus, and the Bible, conceal, under their ample, benevolent wings: shit, animals and days. How can anyone hope to order the chaos that constitutes that infinite, formless variation: man? The principle: ''Love thy neighbour'' is hypocrisy. ''Know thyself'' is utopian, but more acceptable because it includes malice. No pity. After the carnage we are left with the hope of a purified humanity. I always speak about myself because I don't want to convince, and I have no right to drag others in my wake, I'm not compelling anyone to follow me, because everyone makes his art in his own way, if he knows anything about the joy that rises like an arrow up to the astral strata, or that which descends into the mines stewn with the flowers of corpses and fertile spasms. Stalactites: look everywhere for them, in creches magnified by pain, eyes as white as angels' hares. Thus DADA was born*  , out of a need for independence, out of mistrust for the community. People who join us keep their freedom. We don't accept any theories. We've had enough of the cubist and futurist academies: laboratories of formal ideas. Do we make art in order to earn money and keep the dear bourgeoisie happy? Rhymes have the smack of money, and inflexion slides along the line of the stomach in profile. Every group of artists has ended up at this bank, straddling various comets. Leaving the door open to the possibility of wallowing in comfort and food. Here we are dropping our anchor in fertile ground. Here we really know what we are talking about, because we have experienced the trembling and the awakening. Drunk with energy, we are revenants thrusting the trident into heedless flesh. We are streams of curses in the tropical abundance of vertiginous vegetation, resin and rain is our sweat, we bleed and burn with thirst, our blood is strength. Cubism was born out of a simple manner of looking at objects: Cezanne painted a cup twenty centimetres lower than his eyes, the cubists look at it from above, others complicate it appearance by cutting a vertical section through it and soberly placing it to one side (I'm not forgetting the creators, nor the seminal reasons of unformed matter that they rendered definitive). * The futurist sees the same cup in movement, a succession of objects side by side, mischievously embellished by a few guide/lines. This doesn't stop the canvas being either a good or a bad painting destined to form an investment for intellectual capital. The new painter creates a world whose elements are also its means, a sober, definitive, irrefutable work. The new artist protests: he no longer paints (symbolic and illusionistic reproduction) but creates directly in stone, wood, iron, tin, rocks, or locomotive structures capable of being spun in all directions by the limpid wind of the momentary sensation. * Every pictorial or plastic work is unnecessary , even if it is a monster which terrifies servile minds, and not a sickly/sweet object to adorn the refectories of animals in human garb, those illustrations of the sad fable of humanity. / A painting is the art of making two lines, which have been geometrically observed to be parallel, meet on a canvas, before our eyes, in the reality of a world that has been transposed according to new conditions and possibilities. This world is neither specified nor defined in the work, it belongs, in its innumerable variations, to the spectator. For its creator it has neither case nor theory. Order = disorder; ego = non/ego; affirmation / negation: the supreme radiations of an absolute art. Absolute in the purity of its cosmic and regulated chaos, eternal in that globule that is a second which has no duration, no breath, no light and no control. * I appreciate an old work for its novelty. It is only contrast that links us to the past. * Writers who like to moralise and discuss or ameliorate psychological bases have, apart from a secret wish to win, a ridiculous knowledge of life, which they may have classified, parcelled out, canalised; they are determined to see its categories dance when they beat time. Their readers laugh derisively, but carry on: what's the use? There is one kind of literature which never reaches the voracious masses. The work of creative writers, written out of the author's real necessity, and for his own benefit. The awareness of a supreme egoism, wherein laws become significant. * Every page should explode, either because of its profound gravity, or its vortex, vertigo, newness, eternity, or because of its staggering absurdity, the enthusiasm of its principles, or its typography. On the one hand there is a world tottering in its flight, linked to the resounding tinkle of the infernal gamut; on the other hand, there are: the new men. Uncouth, galloping, riding astride on hiccups. And there is a mutilated world and literary medicasters in desperate need of amelioration. I assure you: there is no beginning, and we are not afraid; we aren't sentimental. We are like a raging wind that rips up the clothes of clouds and prayers, we are preparing the great spectacle of disaster, conflagration and decomposition. Preparing to put an end to mourning, and to replace tears by sirens spreading from one continent to another. Clarions of intense joy, bereft of that poisonous sadness. * DADA is the mark of abstraction; publicity and business are also poetic elements. I destroy the drawers of the brain, and those of social organisation: to sow demoralisation everywhere, and throw heaven's hand into hell, hell's eyes into heaven, to reinstate the fertile wheel of a universal circus in the Powers of reality, and the fantasy of every individual. A philosophical questions: from which angle to start looking at life, god, ideas, or anything else. Everything we look at is false. \nI don't think the relative result is any more important than the choice of patisserie or cherries for dessert. The way people have of looking hurriedly at things from the opposite point of view, so as to impose their opinions indirectly, is called dialectic, in other words, heads I wind and tails you lose, dressed up to look scholarly. If I shout: Ideal, Ideal, Ideal Knowledge, Knowledge, Knowledge Boomboom, Boomboom, Boomboom I have recorded fairly accurately Progress, Law, Morals, and all the other magnificent qualities that various very intelligent people have discussed in so many books in order, finally, to say that even so everyone has danced according to his own personal boomboom, and that he's right about his boomboom: the satisfaction of unhealthy curiosity; private bell/ringing for inexplicable needs; bath; pecuniary difficulties; a stomach with repercussions on to life; the authority of the mystical baton formulated as the grand finale of a phantom orchestra with mute bows, lubricated by philtres with a basis of animal ammonia. With the blue monocle of an angel they have dug out its interior for twenty sous worth of unanimous gratitude. * If all of them are right, and if all pills are only Pink, let's try for once not to be right. * People think they can explain rationally, by means of thought, what they write. But it's very relative. Thought is a fine thing for philosophy, but it's relative. Psychoanalysis is a dangerous disease, it deadens man's anti/real inclinations and systematises the bourgeoisie. There is no ultimate Truth. Dialectics is an amusing machine that leads us (in banal fashion) to the opinions which we would have held in any case. Do people really think that, by the meticulous subtlety of logic, they have demonstrated the truth and established the accuracy of their opinions? Even if logic were confined by the senses it would still be an organic disease. To this element, philosophers like to add: The power of observation. But this magnificent quality of the mind is precisely the proof of its impotence. People observe, they look at things from one or several points of view, they choose them from amongst the millions that exist. Experience too is the result of chance and of individual abilities. * Science revolts me when it becomes a speculative system and loses its utilitarian character / which is so useless / but is at least individual. I hate slimy objectivity, and harmony, the science that considers that everything is always in order. Carry on, children, humanity ... Science says that we are nature's servants: everything is in order, make both love and war. Carry on, children, humanity, nice kind bourgeois and virgin journalists... * I am against systems; the most acceptable system is that of have none on no principle. * To complete oneself, to perfect oneself in one's own pettiness to the point of filling the little vase of oneself with oneself, even the courage to fight for and against thought, all this can suddenly infernally propel us into the mystery of daily bread and the lilies of the economic field. DADAIST SPONTANEITY What I call the I/don't/give/a/damn attitude of life is when everyone minds his own business, at the same time as he knows how to respect other individualities, and even how to stand up for himself, the two/step becoming a national anthem, a junk shop, the wireless (the wire/less telephone) transmitting Bach fugues, illuminated advertisements for placards for brothels, the organ broadcasting carnations for God, all this at the same time, and in real terms, replacing photography and unilateral catechism. Active simplicity. The incapacity to distinguish between degrees of light: licking the twilight and floating in the huge mouth filled with honey and excrement. Measured against the scale of Eternity, every action is vain / (if we allow thought to have an adventure whose result would be infinitely grotesque / an important factor in the awareness of human incapacity). But if life is a bad joke, with neither goal nor initial accouchement, and because we believe we ought, like clean chrysanthemums, to make the best of a bad bargain, we have declared that the only basis of understanding is: art. It hasn't the importance that we, old hands at the spiritual, have been lavishing on it for centuries. Art does nobody any harm, and those who are capable of taking an interest in it will not only receive caresses, but also a marvelous chance to people the country of their conversation. Art is a private thing, the artist makes it for himself; a comprehensible work is the product of a journalist, and because at this moment I enjoy mixing this monster in oil paints: a paper tube imitating the metal that you press and automatically squeeze out hatred, cowardice and villainy. The artist, or the poet, rejoices in the venom of this mass condensed into one shopwalker of this trade, he is glad to be insulted, it proves his immutability. The author or the artist praised by the papers observes that his work has been understood: a miserable lining to a collaborating with the heat of an animal incubating the baser instincts. Flabby, insipid flesh multiplying itself with the aid of typographical microbes. We have done violence to the snivelling tendencies in our natures. Every infiltration of this sort is macerated diarrhoea. To encourage this sort of art is to digest it. What we need are strong straightforward, precise works which will be forever misunderstood. Logic is a complication. Logic is always false. It draws the superficial threads of concepts and words towards illusory conclusions and centres. Its chains kill, an enormous myriapod that asphyxiates independence. If it were married to logic, art would be living in incest, engulfing, swallowing its own tail, which still belongs to its body, fornicating in itself, and temperament would become a nightmare tarred and feathered with protestantism, a monument, a mass of heavy, greyish intestines. But suppleness, enthusiasm and even the joy of injustice, that little truth that we practise as innocents and that makes us beautiful: we are cunning, and our fingers are malleable and glide like the branches of that insidious and almost liquid plant; this injustice is the indication of our soul, say the cynics. This is also a point of view; but all flowers aren't saints, luckily, and what is divine in us is the awakening of anti/human action. What we are talking about here is a paper flower for the buttonhole of gentlemen who frequent the ball of masked life, the kitchen of grace, our white, lithe or fleshy girl cousins. They make a profit out of what we have selected. The contradiction and unity of opposing poles at the same time may be true. IF we are absolutely determined to utter this platitude, the appendix of alibidinous, evil/smelling morality. Morals have an atrophying effect, like every other pestilential product of the intelligence. Being governed by morals and logic has made it impossible for us to be anything other than impassive towards policemen / the cause of slavery / putrid rats with whom the bourgeois are fed up to the teeth, and who have infected the only corridors of clear and clean glass that remained open to artists. Every man must shout: there is great destructive, negative work to be done. To sweep, to clean. The cleanliness of the individual materialises after we've gone through folly, the aggressive, complete folly of a world left in the hands of bandits who have demolished and destroyed the centuries. With neither aim nor plan, without organisation: uncontrollable folly, decomposition. Those who are strong in word or in strength will survive, because they are quick to defend themselves; the agility of their limbs and feelings flames on their faceted flanks. Morals have given rise to charity and pity, two dumplings that have grown like elephants, planets, which people call good. There is nothing good about them. Goodness is lucid, clear and resolute, and ruthless towards compromise and politics. Morality infuses chocolate into every man's veins. This task is not ordained by a supernatural force, but by a trust of ideas/ merchants and academic monopolists. Sentimentality: seeing a group of bored and quarrelling men, they invented the calendar and wisdom as a remedy. By sticking labels on to things, the battle of the philosophers we let loose (money/ grubbing, mean and meticulous weights and measures) and one understood once again that pity is a feeling, like diarrhoea in relation to disgust, that undermines health, the filthy carrion job of jeopardising the sun. I proclaim the opposition of all the cosmic faculties to that blennorrhoea of a putrid sun that issues from the factories of philosophical thought, the fight to the death, with all the resources of DADAIST DISGUST Every product of disgust that is capable of becoming a negation of the family is dada; DADA; acquaintance with all the means hitherto rejected by the sexual prudishness of easy compromise and good manners: DADA; abolition of logic, dance of those who are incapable of creation: DADA; every hierarchy and social equation established for values by our valets: DADA; every object, all objects, feelings and obscurities, every apparition and the precise shock of parallel lines, are means for the battle of: DADA; the abolition of memory: DADA; the abolition of archaeology: DADA the abolition of prophets: DADA; the abolition of the future: DADA; the absolute and indiscutable belief in every god that is an immediate product of spontaneity: DADA; the elegant and unprejudiced leap from on harmony to another sphere; the trajectory of a word, a cry, thrown into the air like an acoustic disc; to respect all individualities in their folly of the moment, whether serious, fearful, timid, ardent, vigorous, decided or enthusiastic; to strip one's church of every useless and unwieldy accessory; to spew out like a luminous cascade any offensive or loving thought, \nor to cherish it / with the lively satisfaction that it's all precisely the same thing / with the same intensity in the bush, which is free of insects for the blue/blooded, and gilded with the bodies of archangels, with one's soul. Liberty: DADA''DADA''DADA; / the roar of contorted pains, the interweaving of contraries and all contradictions, freaks and irrelevancies: LIFE."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What did Expressionism want? \nIt ''wanted'' something, that much remains characteristic of it. Dada wants nothing, Dada grows. Expressionism wanted inwardness, it conceived of itself as a reaction against the times, while Dadaism is nothing but an expression of the times. Dada is one with the times, it is a child of the present epoch which one may curse, but cannot deny. Dada has taken the mechanisation, the sterility, the rigidity and the tempo of these times into its broad lap, and in the last analysis it is nothing else and in no way different from them. Expressionism is not spontaneous action. It is the gesture of tired people who wish to escape themselves and forget the present, the war and the misery. To this end they invented ''humanity,'' and walked versifying and psalmodysing along streets on which the escalators rise and descend and the telephones ring shrilly. The Expressionists are tired people who have turned their backs on nature and do not dare look the cruelty of the epoch in the face. They have forgotten how to be daring. Dada is daring per se, Dada exposes itself to the risk of its own death. Dada puts itself at the heart of things. Expressionism wanted to forget itself, Dada wants to affirm itself. Expressionism was harmonious, mystic, angelic, Baaderish-Superdadaist — Dada is the scream of brakes and the bellowing of the brokers at the Chicago Stock Exchange. Vive Dada! \n\nThe execution and direction of art depends on the times in which it lives, and artists are creatures of their epoch. The highest art will be that whose mental content represents the thousandfold problems of the day, which has manifestly allowed itself to be torn apart by the explosions of last week, and which is forever trying to gather up its limbs after the impact of yesterday. The best and most unprecedented artists will be those who continuously snatch the tatters of their bodies out of the chaos of life's cataracts, clutching the intellectual zeitgeist and bleeding from hands and hearts. \n\nHas Expressionism fulfilled our expectations of such an art, one which represents our most vital concerns? \nNo! No! No! \nHave the Expressionists fulfilled our expectations of an art that brands the essence of life into our flesh? \nNo! No! No! \nUnder the pretext of inwardness the Expressionist writers and painters have closed ranks to form a generation which is already expectantly looking forward to an honourable appraisal in the histories of art and literature and is aspiring to honours and accolades. On the pretext of propagating the soul, their struggle with Naturalism has led them back to those abstract, pathetic gestures which are dependent on a cosy, motionless life void of all content. Their stages are cluttered with every manner of kings, poets and Faustian characters, and a theoretical, melioristic understanding of life — whose childish and psychologically naïve style will have to wait for Expressionism's critical afterword — lurking at the backs of their idle minds. Hatred of the press, hatred of advertising, hatred of sensationalism, these indicate people who find their armchairs more important than the din of the streets, and who make it a point of pride to be conned by every petty racketeer. Their sentimental opposition to the times, no better nor worse, no more reactionary nor revolutionary than any other, that feeble resistance with half an eye on prayer and incense when not making papier maché cannon balls from Attic iambics — these are the characteristics of a younger generation which has never known how to be young. Expressionism, which was discovered abroad and has quite typically become a portly idyll in Germany with the expectation of a good pension, has nothing more to do with the aspirations of active people. The signatories of this manifesto have banded together under the battle cry of \nDADA !!!! \nto put forward a new art which they hope will realize new ideals. But what is DADAISM? \nThe word Dada symbolises the most primitive relation to surrounding reality, a relation with which Dadaism in turn establishes a new reality. Life appears as a simultaneous confusion of noises, colours and spiritual rhythms, and is thus incorporated — with all the sensational screams and feverish excitements of its audacious everyday psyche and the entirety of its brutal reality — unwaveringly into Dadaist art. This is the clearly marked dividing line which separates Dada from all previous artistic directions, most particularly from FUTURISM, which recently some imbeciles took to be a new version of impressionist realization. For the first time Dadaism has made a break with the aesthetic approach to life by rending all the slogans of ethics, culture and inwardness, which are mere cloaks for weak muscles, into their component parts. The \nBRUITIST poem \ndepicts a tram as it is, the essence of the tram complete with pensioner Jones's yawns and the squeal of brakes. The \nSIMULTANEIST poem \ndemonstrates the sense of throwing everything into a jumble; Mr Jones sits reading while the Balkan Express crosses the bridge at Nish and a pig whimpers in the cellar of Bloggs the butcher. The \nSTATIC poem \ntransforms words into individuals; from the three letter words appear the woods with treetops, foresters' liveries and wild sows, perhaps even a guest house, perhaps Bellevue or Bella Vista. Dada leads to incredible new possibilities and forms of expression in all of the arts. It turned Cubism into a dance on the stage, it has disseminated the BRUITIST music of the Futurists (whose purely Italian concerns it has no desire to generalize) across all of Europe. The word Dada itself points to the internationalism of the movement, which is not tied to borders, religions or professions. Dada is the international expression of our times, the great malcontent among artistic movements, the artistic reflection of all these offensives, peace conferences, tussles in the vegetable markets, dîners at the Esplanade etc. etc. Dada demands the use of \nnew materials in painting. \nDada is a CLUB, founded here in Berlin, which one may join without any obligation. Here everyone is chairman and anyone can have his say on artistic matters. Dada is not a pretext for the ambitions of a handful of literati (as our enemies would have you believe). Dada is a state of mind which can reveal itself in each and every conversation, so that one is compelled to say: this man is a DADAIST, but that man is not. For this reason the Club Dada has members the world over, in Honolulu as well as in New Orleans and Meseritz. In some situations being a Dadaist might demand that one is more businessman or party politician than artist — just incidentally an artist — for being a Dadaist means allowing oneself to be hurled by things, means being opposed to all stagnation, and that sitting for a moment in a chair is to put one's life at risk (Mr. Wengs had already pulled the revolver from his trouser pocket). A piece of cloth rips between one's fingers, one says yes to a life wishing to elevate itself by negation. Affirmation — negation: the gigantic hocus-pocus of being fires the nerves of the true Dadaist — that's how he lies around, goes to the shoot, cycles — half Pantagruel, half St. Francis, laughing and laughing. In defiance of the aesthetic-ethical outlook! Against the anaemic abstraction of Expressionism! Against the world-reforming theories of literary blockheads! And for Dadaism in word and image, for the spreading of a Dadaist course of events throughout the world. If you are against this manifesto you are a Dadaist! \nTristan Tzara. Franz Jung.

Even if I didn't believe it, it's the truth of the fact that I've put it on paper - because it's a lie that I have FIXED like a butterfly on a hat. Lies circulate - welcome Mister Opportune and Mister Convenient: I arrest them - they're turning into the truth. Thus DADA takes on the job of the two-wheeled cops and of undercover morality. Everyone (at a certain moment) was sound in mind and body. Repeat this 30 times. I consider myself very likeable. Tristan Tzara \n\nII \nA manifesto is a communication made to the whole world, whose only pretensions is to the discovery of an instant cure for political, astronomical, artistic, parliamentary, agronomical and literary syphilis. It may be pleasant, and good-natured, it's always right, it's strong, vigorous and logical. Apropos of logic, I consider myself very likeable. \nTristan Tzara \nPride is the star that yawns and penetrates through the eyes and the mouth, she insists, strikes deep, on her breast is inscribed: you will die. This is her only remedy. Who still believes in doctors? I prefer the poet who is a fart in a steam-engine - he's gentle but he doesn't cry - polite and semi-homosexual, he floats. I don't give a single damn about either one of them. It's by pure (unnecessary) chance that the first should be German and the second Spanish. Far be it from us, in actual fact, the idea of discovering theory of the probability of races and the epistolary perfection of bitterness. \n\nIII \nWe have always made mistakes, but the greatest mistakes are the poems we have written. Gossip has one single raison d'être: the rejuvenation and maintenance of biblical traditions. Gossip is perfecting itself, encouraged by the state-controlled tobacco company, the railways, the hospitals, the undertaking industry and cloth factories. Gossip is encouraged by the culture of the family. Gossip is encouraged by Peter's pence. Every drop of saliva that escapes from a conversation is converted into gold. Since the people have always needed divinities to protect the three essential laws, which are those of God: eating, making love and shitting, since the kinds are on their travels and the laws are too\nhard, the only thing that counts at the moment is gossip. The form under which it most often appears is DADA. There are some people (journalists, lawyers, amateurs, philosophers) who even think that other forms: business, marriages, visits, wars, various conferences, limited companies, politics, accidents, dance halls, economic crises, fits of hysterics, are variations of dada. Not being an imperialist, I don't share their opinion - I believe, rather, that dada is only a divinity of the second order, which must quite simple by placed beside the other forms of the new mechanism of the religions of the interregnum. Is simplicity simple, or dada? I consider myself rather likeable. \nTristan Tzara \n\nIV \nIs poetry necessary? I know that those who shout loudest against it are actually preparing a comfortable perfection for it; they call it the Future Hygienic. People envisage the (ever-impending) annihilation of art. Here they are looking for a more art-like art. Hygiene becomes mygod mygod purity. Must we no longer believe in words? Since when do they express the contrary of what the organ that utters them things and wants?* Herein lies the great secret: \nThought is made in the mouth. \nI still consider myself very likeable. \nTristan Tzara \nA great Canadian philosopher said: Thought and the past are also very likeable. \n*Thinks. wants, and wishes to think \n\nV \nA friend, who is too good a friend of mine not to be very intelligent, said to me the other day: \n\na shudder \na palmist IS ONLY THE\nWAY PEOPLE SAY\ngood morning \ngood evening AND \nWHICH DEPENDS ON THE FORM \nTHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN\nTO\nits forget-me-not \nhis hair \nI answered \nYOU ARE RIGHT\nidiot \nprince BECAUSE \nI AM CONVINCED OF THE\ncontrary \nTartary \nnaturally \nwe hesitate WE ARE NOT (DO NOT) \nright.

I support all the conventions - to suppress them would be to make new ones, which would complicate our lives in a truly repugnant fashion. We wouldn't know any more what if fashionable: to love the children of the first or second marriage. The ''pistil of the pistol'' has often landed us in bizarre and restless situations. To\ndisorder\nmeanings -\nto disorder\nnotions and all the little tropical rains of demoralisation, disorganisation, destruction\nand\nbilliard-breaks,\nare actions which are insured against lightning and recognised as being of public utility. There is one known fact: dadaists are only to be found these days in the French Academy. I nevertheless consider myself very likeable. \nTristan Tzara \n\nVI \nIt seems that this exists: more logical, very logical, too logical, less logical, not very logical, really logical, fairly logical. Well then, draw the inferences. ''I have.'' Now think of the person you love most. ''Have you?'' Tell me the number and I'll tell you the lottery.\n\nVII \nA priori, in other words with its eyes closed, Dada places before action and above all: Doubt. DADA doubts everything. Dada is an armadillo. Everything is Dada, too. Beware of Dada. \n\nAnti-dadaism is a disease: selfkleptomania, man's normal condition, is DADA. But the real dadas are against DADA. \nThe selfkleptomaniac. \nThe person who steals - without thinking of his own interests, or of his will - elements of his individual, is a kleptomaniac. He steals himself. He causes the characters that alienate him from the community to disappear. The bourgeois resemble one another - they're all alike. They used not to be alike. They have been taught to steal - stealing has become a function - the most convenient and least dangerous thing is to steal oneself. They are all very poor. The poor are against DADA. They have a lot to do with their brains. They'll never get to the end of it. They work. The poor are against DADA. He who is against DADA is for me, a famous man said, but then he died. They buried him like a true dadaist. Anno domini Dada. Beware! And remember this example. \n\nVIII \nTO MAKE A DADAIST POEM \nTake a newspaper. Take some scissors. Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem. Cut out the article. Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag. Shake gently. Next take out each cutting one after the other. Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag. Them poem will resemble you. And there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though\nunappreciated by the vulgar herd.* ________________________________________________________________________ * Example: when dogs cross the air in a diamond like ideas and the appendix of the meninx tells the time of the alarm programme (the title is mine) prices they are yesterday suitable next pictures/ appreciate the dream era of the eyes/ pompously that to recite the gospel sort darkens/ group apotheosis imagine said he fatality power of colours/ carved flies (in the theatre) flabbergasted reality a delight/ spectator all to effort of the no more 10 to 12/ during divagation twirls descends pressure/ render some mad single-file flesh on a monstrous crushing stage/ celebrate but their 160 adherents in steps on put on my nacreous/ sumptuous of land bananas sustained illuminate/ joy ask together almost/ of has the a such that the invoked visions/ some sings latter laughs/ exits situation disappears describes she 25 dance bows/ dissimulated the whole of it isn't was/ magnificent has the band better light whose lavishness stage music-halls me/ reappears following instant moves live/ business he didn't has lent/ manner words come these people \n\nIX \nThere are some people who explain, because there are others who learn. Abolish hem and all that's left is dada. Dip your pen into a black liquid with manifesto intentions - it's only your autobiography that you're hatching under the belly of the flowering cerebellum. Biography is the paraphernalia of the famous man. Great or strong. And there\nyou\nare, a simple man like the rest of them, once you've dipped your pen into the ink, full of \n\nPRETENSIONS \n\nwhich manifest themselves in forms as diverse as they are unforeseen, which apply to every form of activity and of state of mind and of mimicry: there you are, full of \n\nAMBITIONS \n\nto keep yourself on the dial of life, in the place where you've only just arrived, to proceed along the illusory and ridiculous upward path towards an apotheosis that only exists in your neurasthenia: there you are, full of \n\nPRIDE \n\ngreater, stronger, more profound than all the others. Dear colleagues: a great man, a little one, a strong, weak, profound, superficial one, \nthat's why you're all going to die.\nThere are some people who have antedated their manifestos to make other people believe that they had the idea of their own greatness a little earlier. My dear colleagues, before after, past future, now yesterday, \nthat's why you're all going to die. \nThere are some people who have said: dada is good because it isn't bad, dada is bad, dada is a religion, dada is a poem, dada is a spirit, dada is sceptical, dada is magic, I know dada. My dear colleagues: good bad, religion poetry, spirit scepticism, definition definition, \nthat's why you're all going to die, \nand you\nwill\ndie, I promise you. The great mystery is a secret, but it's known to a few people. They will never say what dada is. To amuse you once again I'll tell you something like: dada is the dictatorship of the spirit, or dada is the dictatorship of language, \nor else \ndada is the death of the spirit, which will please many of my friends. Friends. \n\nX \nIt is certain that since Gambetta, the war, Panama and the Steinheil affair, intelligence is to be found in the street. The intelligent man has become and all-round, normal person. What we lack, what has some interest, what is rare because he has the anomalies of precious being, the freshness and liberty of the great antimen, is \n\nTHE IDIOT \n\nDada is working with all its might towards the universal installation of the idiot. But consciously. And tends itself to become more and more of one. Dada is terrible: it doesn't feel sorry about the defeats of intelligence. Dada could rather be called cowardly, but cowardly like a mad dog; it recognises neither method nor persuasive excess. The lack of garters which makes it systematically bend down reminds us of the famous lack of system which basically has never existed. The false rumour was started by a laundress at the bottom of her page, the page was taken to the barbaric country where humming-birds act as the sandwich-men of cordial nature. This was told me by a watch-maker who was holding a supple syringe which, in characteristic memory of the hot countries, he called phlegmatic and insinuating. \n\nXI \nDada is a dog - a compass - the lining of the stomach - neither new nor a nude Japanese\ngirl - a gasometer of jangled feelings - Dada is brutal and doesn't go in for propaganda - Dada is a quantity of life in transparent, effortless and gyratory transformation. \n\nXII \ngentlemen and ladies buy come in and buy and don't read you'll see the fellow who has in his hands the key to niagara the man with a game leg in the game box his hemispheres in a suitcase his nose enclosed in a chinese lantern you'll see you'll see you'll see the belly dance in the massachusetts saloon the fellow who sticks the nail in and the tyre goes down mademoiselle atlantide's silk stockings the trunk that goes 6 times round the world to find the addressee monsieur and his fiancee his brother and his sister-in-law you'll find the carpenter's address the toad-watch the nerve like a paper-knife you'll have the address of the minor pin for the feminine sex and that of the fellow who supplies the obscene photos to the kind of greece as well as the address of\nl'action francaise. \n\nXIII \nDADA is a virgin microbe \nDADA is against the high cost of living \nDADA limited company for the exploitation of ideas \nDADA has 391 different attitudes and colours according to the sex of the president It changes - affirms - says the opposite at the same time - no importance - shouts - goes fishing. \nDada is the chameleon of rapid and self-interested change. \nDada is against the future. Dada is dead. Dada is absurd. Long live Dada. Dada is not a literary school, howl \nTristan Tzara\n\nXIV \nTo ''prettify'' life in the lorgnette - a blanket of caresses - a panoply with butterflies - that's the life of life's chambermaids. \nTo sleep on a razor and on fleas in rut - to travel in a barometer - to piss like a cartridge - to make faux pas, be idiotic, take showers of holy minutes - be beaten, always be the last one - shout out the opposite of what the other fellow says - be the editorial office and the bathroom of God who every day takes a bath in us in company with the cesspool clearer - that's the life of dadaists. \nTo be intelligent - respect everyone - die on the field of honour - subscribe to the Loan - vote for So-and-So - respect for nature and painting - to barrack at dada manifestations - that's the life of men. \n\nXV \nDADA is not a doctrine to be put into practice: Dada - is for lying: a successful business. Dada gets into debt and doesn't live on its well-filled wallet. The good Lord created a universal language, that's why people don't take him seriously. A language is a utopia. God can allow himself not to be successful: so can Dada. That's why the critics say: Dada goes in for luxuries, or Dada is in rut. God goes in for luxuries, or God is in rut. Who's right: God, Dada or the critic? \n''You're deviating,'' a charming reader tells me. \n- No no, not at all! I simply wanted to reach the conclusion: Subscribe to Dada, the only loan that doesn't pay. \n\nXVI\nhowl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl howl Who still considers himself very likeable \nTristan Tzara \n\nhow i became charming, likeable and delightful \nby tristan tzara \n19th december 1920 \n\nI sleep very late. I commit suicide at 65%. My life is very cheap, it's only 30% of life for me. My life has 30% of life. It lacks arms, strings and a few buttons. 5% is devoted to a state of semi-lucid stupor accompanied by anaemic crackling. This 5% is called DADA. So life is cheap. Death is a bit more expensive. But life is charming and death is equally charming. A few days ago I was at a meeting of imbeciles. There were a lot of people there. Everyone was charming. Tristan Tzara, a small, absurd and insignificant individual was giving a lecture on the art of becoming charming. He was charming, at that. Everyone is charming. And witty. It's delightful, isn't it? Everyone is delightful, at that. 9 degrees below zero. It's charming, isn't it? No, it isn't charming. God isn't up to it. He isn't even in the directory. But even so he's charming. Ambassadors, poets, counts, princes, musicians, journalists, actors, writers, diplomats,\ndirectors, dressmakers, socialists, princesses and baronesses are charming. You're all of you charming, very subtle, witty and delightful. Tristan Tzara says to you: he's quite willing to do something else, but he prefers to remain an idiot, a practical joker and a hoaxer. Be sincere for a moment: what I've just said to you - is it charming or idiotic? There are some people (journalists, lawyers, amateurs, philosophers) who even think that business, marriages, visits, wars, various conferences, limited companies, politics, accidents, dance halls, economic crises, fits of hysterics, are variations of dada. Not being an imperialist, I don't share their opinion. I believe rather, that dada is only a divinity of the second order, which must quite simply be placed beside the other forms of the new mechanism of the religions of the interregnum. Is simplicity simple, or dada? I consider myself rather likeable. \nTristan Tzara \n\nThank you, Francis! \nby Francis Picabia \nJanuary 1923 \nOne must become acquainted with everybody except oneself; one must not know which sex one belongs to; I do not care whether I am male or female, I do not admire men more than I do women. Having no virtue, I am assured of not suffering from them. Many people seek the road which can lead them to their ideal: I have no ideal; the person who parades his ideal is only an arriviste. Undoubtedly, I am also an arriviste, but my lack of scruples is an invention for myself, a subjectivity. Objectively it would consist of awarding myself the légion d'honneur, of wishing to become a minister or of plotting to get into the Institute! Well, for me, all that is shit! \nWhat I like is to invent, to imagine, to make myself a new man every moment, then forget him, forget everything. We should be equipped with a special eraser, gradually effacing our works and the memory of them. Our brain should be nothing back a "}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Such is the belief in life, in the most precarious aspects of life, by which is meant real life, that in the end belief is lost. Man, that inveterate dreamer, more and more discontented day by day with his fate, orbits with difficulty around the objects he has been led to make use of, those which indifference has handed him, or his own efforts, almost always his efforts, since he has consented to labour, at least he has not been averse to chancing his luck (what he calls his luck!). A vast modesty is now his lot: he knows what women he has had, what foolish affairs he has been involved in; riches or poverty are nothing to him, he remains in this respect a new-born babe, and as for the consent of his moral conscience, I admit that he does very well without it. If he retains any degree of lucidity, he can do no more than turn to his childhood, which ruined as it has been by his teachers’ pains, seems to him nonetheless full of charm. There, the absence of all familiar constraint, furnishes him with a perspective of several lives lived simultaneously; he becomes rooted in this illusion; he no longer wishes to know anything beyond the momentary and extreme facility of everything. Each morning, children set off without concern. Everything is near, the worst material circumstances are fine. The woods are black or white, one will never need to sleep again. \nBut it is true we would never dare venture so far, it is not merely a question of distance. Menace accumulates, one yields, one abandons a part of the terrain to be conquered. That same imagination that knows no limits, is never permitted to be exercised except according to arbitrary laws of utility; it is incapable of assuming this inferior role for long, and at about the age of twenty, prefers, in general, to abandon Man to his unilluminated destiny. \nLet him try, later, now and then, to collect himself, having felt himself little by little losing all reason to live, incapable as he has become of rising to the heights of an exceptional situation such as love, and he will hardly succeed. That is because, from now on, he belongs body and soul to an imperious practical necessity, of which one must never lose sight. His gestures will lose all their expansiveness, his ideas all their grandeur. In what happens to him or might happen, he will perceive only what relates such events to a host of similar events, events in which he has not taken part, waste events. Rather, he will assess them with regard to some one of those events, more reassuring in its outcome than the rest. On no account, will he consider them as offering him salvation. \nDear imagination, what I love most about you, is your unforgiving nature. \nThe only mark of freedom is whatever still exalts me. I believe it right to maintain forever, our oldest human fanaticism. Indeed that reflects my sole legitimate aspiration. Amidst all the shame we are heir to, it is well to recognize that the widest freedom of spirit remains to us. It is up to us not to abuse it in any serious manner. To make a slave of the imagination, even though what is vulgarly called happiness is at stake, is to fail profoundly to do justice to one’s deepest self. Only imagination realises the possible in me, and it is enough to lift for a moment the dreadful proscription; enough also for me to abandon myself to it, without fear of error (as if one could be any more in error). Where does error begin, and security end for the spirit? Is not the possibility of error, for the spirit, rather a circumstance conducive to its well-being? \nMadness remains, ‘the madness one locks away’ as has been so aptly said. That madness or another...Everyone knows, in fact, that the mad owe their incarceration to a number of legally reprehensible actions, and that were it not for those actions, their liberty (or what we see as their liberty) would not be at risk. They may be, in some measure, victims of their imagination, I am prepared to concede that, in the way that it induces them not to observe certain rules, without which the species feels threatened, which it pays us all to be aware of. But the profound indifference they show for the judgement we pass on them, and even the various punishments inflicted on them, allows us to suppose that they derive great solace from imagination, that they enjoy their delirium enough to endure the fact that it is only of value to themselves. And, indeed, hallucinations, illusions etc, are no slight source of pleasure. The most well-ordered sensuality partakes of it, and I know there are many evenings when I would gladly tame that pretty hand which in the last pages of Taine’s L’Intelligence, indulges in some curious misdeeds. The confidences of the mad, I could pass my whole life inspiring them. They are a scrupulously honest tribe, whose innocence has no peer but my own. Columbus ought to have taken madmen with him to discover America. And see how that folly has gained substance, and endured. \nIt is not the fear of foolishness that compels us to leave the banner of imagination furled. \nThe case against the realist position needs to be considered, after considering the materialist position. The latter, more poetic however than the former, admittedly implies on the part of a Man, a monstrous pride, but not a new and more complete degeneration. It should be seen, above all, as a welcome reaction against certain ridiculous spiritualist tendencies. Ultimately, it is not incompatible with a certain nobility of thought. \nThe realistic position, in contrast, inspired by positivism, from Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, appears to me to be totally hostile to all intellectual and moral progress. It horrifies me, since it arises from mediocrity, hatred and dull conceit. It is what engenders all the ridiculous books, and insulting plays of our day. It feeds on newspaper articles, and holds back science and art, while applying itself to flattering the lowest tastes of its readers; clarity bordering on stupidity, the life lived by dogs. The activity of the best minds is affected by it, the law of the lowest common denominator imposes itself on them, in the end, as on the others. One amusing result of this state of things, in literature for example, is the vast quantity of novels. Each brings its little measure of ‘observation’. Feeling in need of a purge, Paul Valéry recently suggested the compilation of an anthology of as great a number as possible of opening passages from novels, hoping much from the ensuing bouts of insanity. The most famous of authors would be included. Such an idea reflects honour on Paul Valéry who, some time ago, on the subject of novels, assured me that, as far as he was concerned, he would continue to refrain from writing: The Marquise went out at five. But has he kept his word? \nIf the declarative style, pure and simple, of which the sentence just offered is an example, is almost the rule in novels, it is because, as one must recognise, the authors’ ambition is quite limited. The circumstantial, needlessly specific, nature of their respective writings, leads me to think they are amusing themselves at my expense. They spare me not a single one of their issues of characterisation: will he be fair-haired, what will he be called, will we encounter him in summer? So many questions, resolved once and for all, haphazardly; the only power of choice I am left with is to close the book, which I take care to do at about the first page. And the descriptions! Nothing can be compared to their vacuity; it is nothing but the superimposition of images from a catalogue, the author employs them more and more readily, he seizes the opportunity to slip me postcards, he tries to make me fall in step with him in public places: \n‘The small room into which the young man was shown was decorated with yellow wallpaper: there were geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows; the setting sun cast a harsh light over all...There was nothing special about the chamber. The furniture, of yellow wood, was all quite old. A sofa with a tall curved back, an oval table opposite the sofa, a dressing table and mirror set against the overmantel, chairs against the walls, two or three etchings of little value, representing German girls holding birds in their hands – amounted to all the furniture.’ (Dostoevsky, Crime and Punishment) \nI am in no mood to admit, even for a moment, that the mind welcomes such motifs. It may be argued that this childish description has its place, and that at this point in the novel the author has his reasons for burdening me with it, but he is wasting his time since I avoid entering his room. The idleness, the fatigue of others does not interest me. I have too fragile a notion of life’s continuity to equate my moments of depression and weakness with my best. I prefer one to be silent, when one ceases to feel. Understand that I am not condemning lack of originality for its lack of originality. I simply say that I take no notice of the empty hours of life, and that it may be an unworthy action for any man to crystallise out those which seem so to him. Allow me to ignore that description of a room, along with a host of others. \nWhoa, I’m into psychology, a subject about which I’ll take care not to jest. \nThe author seizes on a character, and, this being granted, makes the hero wander about the world. Whatever occurs, this hero, whose actions and reactions are admirably predictable, must not disturb, despite seeming to be about to do so, the calculations of which he is the object. The seas of life can appear to raise him, toss him about, and sink him again, he will always revert to that pre-formed human type. A simple game of chess which I am wholly disinterested in, Man, in whatever form, being a mediocre adversary. What I can’t bear are those wretched debates over this or that move, which have no bearing on winning or losing. And if the game’s not worth the candle, if objective reason serves so terribly, as it does, whoever summons it, is it not right to avoid such categories? ‘Diversity is as broad as all the tones of voice, manners of walking, coughing, blowing one’s nose, sneezing....(Pascal, Pensées, B114) \nIf a bunch of grapes contains no two alike, why do you need me to describe this grape among others, among all others, to make a grape worth eating?

If the general ideas proposed for discussion by philosophy to date signalled thereby their definitive incursion in a wider domain, I would be the first to rejoice.

We must give thanks to Freud for his discoveries. On the basis of his research, a current of opinion is at last flowing, by means of which the explorer of humanity will be able to push his investigations much further, authorised as he will be to take account of more than merely superficial realities. Imagination may be on the point of re-asserting its rights. If the depths of our spirits contain strange forces capable of supplementing those on the surface, or waging victorious war against them, there is every reason to seize on them, seize on them and then, if needs be, submit them to the control of reason. Analysts themselves have everything to gain from it. But it is worth noting that the means of conducting such an enterprise is not defined a priori, that until further notice, it can be taken to be the province of poets as well as scientists, and that its success will not depend upon the paths, more or less capricious, which are followed. \nVery rightly, Freud applied his critical faculties to dreams. It is unacceptable, indeed, that this considerable part of psychic activity (since, from the birth to death of human beings at least, thought presents no solution to continuity: the sum of the dream moments, from a temporal viewpoint, and considering only pure dream in sleep, being in no way inferior to the sum of moments of reality, or to be precise, waking moments) has still received so little attention. The vast difference in importance, in weight, that the ordinary observer grants to events while awake and asleep, has always astonished me. It is because human beings, when they cease to sleep, are above all the playthings of memory, and memory in its normal state takes pleasure in re-tracing the events of dreams only feebly, depriving the latter of all real importance, and distancing the sole determinant from the point where it thinks, several hours later, that it was left: a solid hope, a going concern. It has the illusion of continuing something worthwhile. Dream finds itself reduced to a parenthesis, like the night. And, in general, delivers as little information as night does. This curious state of affairs seems to me to call for certain reflections: \n\n1. Within the bounds in which they operate (or are thought to operate), dreams, to all appearances, are continuous and show signs of order. Memory alone arrogates to itself the right to recall excerpts, to ignore transitions, and to represent it to us rather as a series of dreams than the dream itself. By the same token, we possess at any moment only a single distinct configuration of reality, whose coordination is a matter of will. (Account must be taken of the depth of the dream. For the most part I retain only what I can glean from its most superficial layers. What I delight in contemplating most about a dream is whatever sinks back beneath the surface when awake, all I have forgotten concerning my previous day’s activities, dark leaves, dense branches. In reality, similarly, I prefer to fall.) What is worth noting, is that nothing permits us to infer a more profound dissipation of the constituent elements of dream. I regret having to speak according to a formula which excludes dream, in principle. When will there be sleeping logicians, sleeping philosophers! I would like to sleep, to surrender myself to the dreamers, as I deliver myself to those who read to me, eyes wide open; to cease from imposing, in this realm, the conscious rhythm of my thoughts. My dream last night, perhaps it continues that of the preceding night, and will in turn be continued the following night, with exemplary rigour. It’s quite possible, as they say. And since there is not the slightest proof that, in doing so, the ‘reality’ which preoccupies me still exists in the dream state, failing to sink back behind memory, why should I not accord dream what I occasionally refuse reality, that quality of certainty in itself, which, in its own domain of time, is free from exposure to my repudiation? Why should I not expect more from dream-signs than I expect from a degree of consciousness daily more acute? Can the dream not also be applied to the solution of life’s fundamental questions? Are they the same questions in one case as the other, and are those questions already there in dream? Is the dream any less subject to sanctions than the rest? I age, and more than that reality to which I believe myself subject, it is perhaps the dream, the indifference I show towards it, which ages me. \n\n2. I return, once more, to the state of being awake. I am obliged to consider it as a phenomenon due to interference. Not only does the mind display, in this state, a strange tendency towards disorientation (a tale of lapses and errors of all sorts the secret of which is beginning to be revealed) but what is more it seems that when the mind is functioning normally it does no more than respond to suggestions which come to it from the depths of that night to which I commend it. However well balanced it is, its equilibrium is a relative one. It scarcely dares to express itself, and, when it does, limits itself to verifying that some idea, some female has made an impression on it. What impression, it would be quite incapable of saying, showing by that the measure of its subjectivity, no more. This idea, or female, troubles it, inducing it to be less strict. It has the effect of separating it, for a moment, from its solvent, and depositing it over the heavens, as the lovely precipitate that it can become, that it is. When all else fails, it calls upon chance, a divinity more obscure even than the others, to whom it attributes its distraction. Who can say that the angle at which this idea which stirs it is presented, what it loves in that woman’s eye, is not precisely what ties it to dream, binds it to the data which through its own fault it has lost? And if things were otherwise, what might it not be capable of? I would like to grant it the key to this passage. \n\n3. The spirit of the man who dreams is quite content with what happens to him. The agonising question of possibility is no longer posed. Kill, fly faster, love to your heart’s content. And if you die, are you not certain of waking among the dead? Let yourself be led, events will not allow you to defer them. You have no name. The easiness of it all is inestimable. What reason, I ask, a reason so much greater than that other, confers the natural quality on dream, makes me welcome unreservedly a host of episodes whose strangeness would confound me as I write? And yet I can believe my own eyes, and ears; the great day has arrived, the beast has spoken. If Man’s awakening is harder, if it breaks the spell too abruptly, it is because he has been led to accept an impoverished idea of expiation. \n\n4. From the moment it is subjected to methodical investigation, when by means yet to be determined, we succeed in accounting for dream in its entirety (and that presupposes a discipline in the use of memory spanning generations; but let us start all the same by registering the salient facts) when the curve of its graph will progress with unparalleled regularity and amplitude, we may hope that mysteries which are no such thing will give way to the great Mystery. I believe in the future resolution of these two states, seemingly so contradictory, of dream and reality, in a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, so to speak. That is the quest I am about, certain not to find it, but too heedless of death not to weigh a little the joys of its possession. They say that every evening, before he slept, Saint-Pol-Roux (the Symbolist poet) used to have posted on the door of his manor house at Camaret, a notice which read: POET AT WORK. There is a great deal more to be said, but in passing I simply wished to touch on a subject which would alone necessitate a long, altogether more rigorous, discussion: I will return to it. At this point, it was my intention to do justice to that hatred of the marvellous which rages in certain individuals, to that ridicule beneath which they would like to bury it. Let’s not beat about the bush: the marvellous is always beautiful, everything marvellous is beautiful, only the marvellous could be beautiful. \n\nIn the realm of literature, the marvellous alone is capable of making fertile those works which belong to a lesser genre such as the novel, everything in general that involves storytelling. Lewis’s The Monk bears admirable witness to this. A breath of the marvellous animates it throughout. Long before the author has delivered his characters from all temporal constraint, one feels them ready to act with unprecedented pride. That passion for eternity that stirs them incessantly lends an unforgettable intensity to their torments and mine. I mean that the book, from beginning to end, and in the purest way, exalts only that part of the spirit which aspires to quit the ground; and that stripped of an insignificant portion of its novelistic plot, belonging to its period, it constitutes a model of accuracy and innocent grandeur. (What is admirable about fantasy is that nothing fantastic remains, there is only the real) It seems to me that no one has bettered it, and that the character of Matilda in particular is the most moving creation that one could credit to the figurative mode in literature. She is less a character than a continual temptation. And if a character is not a temptation, what is? An extreme temptation, she. The ‘nothing is impossible to he who dares’ is in The Monk given its full and convincing measure. Ghosts play a logical role in it, since the critical mind does not seize on them to contest their being. Likewise Ambrosio’s punishment is treated in a legitimate way, since it is ultimately accepted by the critical mind as a natural denouement. \nt may seem arbitrary for me to propose this example, when discussing the marvellous, from which the literature of the North and Oriental literature has borrowed time and again, without mentioning the truly religious literature of every land. It is simply that most of the examples those literatures might furnish me with are tainted by puerility, for the sole reason that they are addressed to children. At an early age children are weaned on the marvellous, and later, fail to retain sufficient virginity of mind to really enjoy Cinderella. Charming as the stories may be, adults would consider it demeaning to nourish themselves on fairy- tales, and I would agree they are not suitable for them. The web of adorable unrealities requires to be spun a little more finely, the older we get, and one is left waiting for that species of spider...But the faculties do not change radically. Fear, the attraction of the unusual, chance, the taste for the extravagant, are devices which we will never summon in vain. There are stories to be written for grown-ups, stories as yet quite rare. \nThe marvellous is not the same in all ages; it participates obscurely in some kind of general revelation of which only the particulars reach us: romantic ruins, the modern mannequin or any other symbol capable of stirring the human sensibility for any length of time. In those appurtenances that make us smile, there is forever revealed an incurable human restlessness, and that is why I take them into consideration, why I judge them inseparable from certain products of genius, which are painfully affected by them more than others. They are Villon’s gibbets, Racine’s Greeks, Baudelaire’s couches. They coincide with an eclipse of taste which I am made to endure, I whose idea of taste is a large stain. Amidst the bad taste of my age, I force myself to go further than anyone else. It is I, If I had lived in 1820, I ‘the blood-stained nun’, I, who would not have refrained from that banal and deceitful ‘let us dissimulate’ of which the parodic J.P.R Cuisin speaks, I who would have revelled, I, in gigantic metaphors, as they say, in all the phases of the ‘Silvered Disc’. \nFor now, I think of a castle, of which at least half is not necessarily in ruins; the castle belongs to me, I picture it in a rural setting not far from Paris. The outbuildings are endless, and as for the interior, it has been utterly restored, in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired in the way of comfort. There are autos parked near the door, cloaked by the shadows of trees. A few of my friends are installed on the premises: there is Louis Aragon departing; he only has time to wave to you; Philippe Soupault rises with the stars and Paul Éluard, our mighty Éluard, has not yet returned. There are Robert Desnos and Roger Vitrac, out in the park, deciphering an old edict on duelling; Georges Auric, Jean Paulhan; Max Morise, who rows so well, and Benjamin Péret, occupied with his equations of birds; and Joseph Delteil; and Jean Carrive; and Georges Limbour, and Georges Limbour (there is a whole hedge of Georges Limbour); and Marcel Noll; there is T. Fraenkel gesturing to us from his captive balloon, Georges Malkine, Antonin Artaud, Francis Gérard, Pierre Naville, J.-A. Boiffard, then Jacques Baron and his brother, both of them handsome and cordial, and so many others too, and what ravishing women. These young men, how could one refuse them a thing, their wishes are, as to wealth, commands. Francis Picabia is about to visit, and last week, in the hall of mirrors we received a certain Marcel Duchamp previously unknown to us. Picasso hunts in the neighbourhood. The spirit of demoralisation has taken up residence in the castle, and we have to deal with it whenever there is a question of relating to our peers, but the doors are always open and one does not commence by ‘thanking’ the world, you know. Moreover, the solitude is vast, we don’t often encounter one another. Then isn’t the essential thing that we are masters of ourselves, and masters of women, and of love too? \nI will be convicted of poetic deceit: everyone will go about saying I live on the Rue Fontaine, and they won’t swallow that tale. So what! Are they so sure that the castle to which I invite them is only a phantom? What if the castle exists! My guests are there to prove it; their fancy is the luminous road that leads there. It is really our fantasies we inhabit, when we are there. And how could what one person does bother another, there, in the refuge of sentimental pursuit and occasional meeting? \nMan proposes and disposes. It falls to him alone to belong to himself completely, that is to maintain the host of his desires, daily more formidable, in a state of anarchy. Poetry teaches him to do so. It bears within itself a perfect compensation for the miseries we endure. It can also be a means of organisation, if ever under the influence of a less intimate disappointment we choose to take it quite seriously. The time is coming when it will decree an end to money and itself will break heaven’s bread for the earth! There will still be gatherings in public squares, and movements in which you never dared hope to take part. Farewell to absurd choice, dreams of the abyss, rivalries, endless patience, the flight of the seasons, the artificial ordering of ideas, the balustrade of danger, the time for everything! Only let us take pains to practice poetry. Does it not fall to us, who are already living, to try to make that which we propose for our much wider field of enquiry, prevail? \n\nIt is irrelevant whether there is a degree of disproportion between this defence and the illustration of it that follows. It was a matter of returning to the sources of poetic imagination, and what’s more, of staying there. Not that I pretend to have done so. It would be to take a great deal on oneself to wish to establish oneself in those remote regions where everything at first appears so troublesome, all the more so if you wish to lead someone else there. Besides, one is never quite sure of really being there. If you are taking all that trouble, you are also tempted to stop elsewhere. The fact remains that an arrow now points in the direction of those regions, and that to attain the true goal only depends on the traveller’s powers of endurance. \nWe know, more or less, the road travelled. I was careful to relate, in an analysis of the case of Robert Desnos, entitled: THE ENTRANCE OF THE MEDIUMS (ENTRÉE DES MÉDIUMS, Littérature, nouvelle série no. 6 November 1, 1922) that I had been ‘led to focus my attention on more or less partial phrases which, in complete solitude, on the verge of sleep, become perceptible to the mind without being able to discover in them any prior intention.’ I had at that time attempted the poetic venture with minimum risk, that is my aspirations were the same as today, but I trusted in tardiness of elaboration, to protect me from useless proximity, a proximity of which I wholly disapproved. In that lay a modesty of thought of which some vestiges remain. At the end of my life, I will doubtless manage with difficulty to speak as others do, apologising for my voice and paucity of gesture. The virtue of speech (and writing, moreover) seemed to me to spring from the ability to contract in a striking way the exposition (since such it was) of a small number of facts, poetic or otherwise, of which I made myself the subject. I concluded that Rimbaud proceeded no differently. I composed, with a concern for variation which merited more, the last poems of Pawn-Shop (Mont de piété, 1919), that is I managed to derive incredible benefit from the blank lines of that book. Those lines were the eye, closed to the operations of thought that I believed I should hide from my readers. That was not deceit on my part, but a delight in shocking them. I achieved the illusion of potential complicity, which I had more and more difficulty in relinquishing. I had begun to cherish words immoderately for they space they admit around them, for their tangencies with a host of other words I did not utter. The poem BLACK-FOREST derives from precisely this state of mind. It took me six months to write and take my word for it I did not leave off for a single day. But you will understand that it stemmed rather from my self-esteem at that time, I love these foolish confessions. At that time, Cubist pseudo-poetry was trying to gain a hearing, but it had emerged helpless from Picasso’s brain and as far as I was concerned I was thought to be as dull as ditchwater (I still am). I suspected, moreover, that from the poetic point of view I had taken a wrong turning, but I hedged my bets the best I could, defying lyricism with a barrage of definitions and formulae (the phenomenon of Dada was soon to appear) and pretending to be searching for an application of poetry to advertising (I claimed that the world would end, not with a good book, but a brilliant advertisement for heaven or hell). \nIn those days, a man, at least as boring as I, Pierre Reverdy, wrote: The image is a pure creation of the mind. It cannot be born from a comparison but from a juxtaposition of two more or less remote realities. The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is remote and true, the stronger the image – the greater its emotive power and poetic reality....etc. (Nord-Sud, March 1918) \nThese words, however Sibylline to the uninitiated, were extremely revealing and I meditated on them for a long while. But the image eluded me. Reverdy’s aesthetic, an aesthetic totally a posteriori, led me to mistake effects for causes. It was amidst all this that I was driven to renounce my point of view, irrevocably. \n\nOne evening then, before falling asleep, I perceived, so clearly articulated that it was impossible to change a word, but distinct however from the sound of any voice, a quite bizarre phrase which came to me without bearing any trace of the events in which, my consciousness agrees, I found myself involved at that time, a phrase which seemed to me insistent, a phrase, dare I say it, that came knocking at the window. I took swift note of it, and prepared to move on, when its organic nature struck me. Truly the phrase astonished me; I have unfortunately been unable to recapture it precisely even today; but it was something like: ‘There is a man sliced in two by the window’, but it suffered no ambiguity, accompanied as it was by a faint visual representation of a man walking, severed half-way up by a window at right angles to the axis of his body. (Were I a painter, this visual image would no doubt have seemed more important to me than the other. It was indeed my prior predisposition which decided the issue. Since that day, I have had occasion to focus my attention at will on similar apparitions, and I know they are just as clear as auditory phenomena. With a pencil and a sheet of blank paper to hand, I could easily trace their outlines. Here again it is not a matter of depicting but merely tracing. In this way I could reproduce a tree, a wave, a musical instrument, a host of things, of which I am currently incapable of achieving even the roughest sketch. I would dive in, convinced of finding my way through a maze of lines which at first sight seemed to be heading nowhere. Then on opening my eyes I would gain the intense impression of something ‘previously unseen’. The proof of what I am saying has been demonstrated many times by Robert Desnos: to convince oneself, one has simply to leaf through the pages of issue 36 of Feuilles libres which contains several of his drawings, Romeo and Juliet, A Man Died This Morning etc., which were accepted by that journal as the drawings of a madman and published as such). \nWithout question, what offered itself was a simple presentation in space of a man leaning from a window. But the window having followed the man’s movements, I realised that I was dealing with an image of a sufficiently rare kind, and I could think of nothing but how to incorporate it among my materials for poetic construction. I had no sooner accorded it this place however than it was succeeded by an almost continuous succession of phrases, scarcely less surprising, and leaving me with an impression of gratuitousness such that the control I had exercised over myself up till then seemed illusory and all I could think of was putting an end to the interminable quarrel taking place within me. (Knut Hamson attributes this kind of revelation of which I was the recipient as deriving from hunger, and he may be right, since it is true I did not eat every day during that period of my life. Certainly the manifestations he describes are clearly the same: \n‘The next day I woke early. It was still dark. My eyes had been open a long while when I heard a clock in the apartment above strike five. I wanted to go back to sleep but could not. I was wide awake and a host of thoughts flooded through my mind. Suddenly a few choice fragments came to mind, perfectly suitable for use in a rough draft, or to be serialised; instantly I found, quite by chance, lovely phrases such as I had never conceived. I repeated them to myself slowly, word by word; they were excellent. And still more followed. I rose and snatched a pencil and paper from the table behind my bed. It as a though an artery had burst inside me, one word followed another, found its correct position, adapted itself to the context, scene piled on scene, events unfolded, one vessel after another bubbled in my mind, and I was enjoying myself immensely. Thoughts came so swiftly and flowed so copiously that a whole host of subtle details escaped me, because my pencil could not keep up with them, and yet I went as fast as I could, my hand in continual motion, not losing an instant. The sentences continued to well up within me; I was pregnant with my subject.’ \nApollinaire claimed that Chirico’s first paintings were created under the influence of cenesthetic disorder (migraine, colic, etc.) \n\nTotally preoccupied with Freud as I then was and familiar with his methods of investigation which I had some slight occasion to practice on patients during the war, I resolved to obtain from myself what one tries to obtain from others, namely a monologue delivered as rapidly as possible, on which the critical mind of the subject is unable to pass judgement, unembarrassed consequently by reticence, comprising, as precisely as possible, spoken thought. It appeared to me, , and still does – the manner in which the phrase about the man sliced in two came to me bears witness to it – that the speed of thought is no greater than that of speech, and does not necessarily defy capture in language, nor even the flow of the pen. It was in this frame of mind that Philippe Soupault, to whom I had confided these initial conclusions, and I, undertook to blacken some paper, with a laudable disdain for what might ensue of a literary nature. Ease of execution achieved the rest. At the end of the first day, we were able to read through fifty or so pages obtained in this manner, and began comparing our results. All in all, Soupault’s pages and mine were remarkably analogous: the same poor construction, similar deficiencies, but also, on both our parts, the impression of extraordinary eloquence, much emotion, a considerable selection of images of a quality such that we would not have been capable of creating a single one in longhand, a very special quality of the picturesque and, here and there, a certain piquant buffoonery. The only apparent difference between our two texts seemed to me to derive in essence from our respective temperaments, Soupault’s being less static than mine, and if I allow myself this mild criticism, from the fact that he had committed the error of placing at the top of certain pages, and no doubt in a spirit of mystification, a few words by way of title. I must, on the other hand, do him justice, in that he was constantly, and forcefully, opposed to the least re-touching, the least correction, of any passage of this kind which appeared at all ill-conceived. In that, he was indeed absolutely right. (I believe, more and more, in the infallibility of my thoughts with respect to myself, and that is more than reasonable. Nevertheless, with this thought- writing, where one is at the mercy of the first distraction from outside, ‘ebullitions’ may occur. It would be inexcusable to pretend otherwise. Thought, by definition, is overpowering, and incapable of detecting itself in an error. The blame for such obvious weaknesses must be placed on suggestions that reach it from outside.) It is, in fact, very difficult to assess the various elements present at their true value, one might even say it is impossible to appreciate them at first reading. On writing them, these elements are, to all appearances, as strange to you as to others, and naturally you are wary of them. Poetically speaking, they strike you above all by a high degree of instantaneous absurdity, the quality of this absurdity, on closer examination, being to make room for everything admissible, legitimate in the world: the disclosure of a certain number of properties and facts no less objective, in the end, than all the rest. \nIn homage to Guillaume Apollinaire, who recently died, and who, on several occasions, seemed to us to pursue a discipline of this kind, without however having relinquished in doing so an indifferent literary method, Soupault and I designated the new mode of pure expression we had adopted and whose benefit we wished to bestow on our friends, by the name of SURREALISM. I see no point now in dwelling on the word, the meaning we have given it having generally prevailed over the that of Apollinaire. To bestow a yet more appropriate title on it, we could no doubt have appropriated the word SUPERNATURALISM , employed by Gérard de Nerval in the dedication to his Girls of Fire (Filles du feu, 1854) and also by Thomas Carlyle in Sartor Resartus (Book III, Chapter VIII, ‘Natural Supernaturalism’). It seems, in fact, that Nerval possessed to a marvellous degree that spirit with which we claim kinship.

Apollinaire, having possessed, in contrast, only the letter, as yet imperfect, of Surrealism, and having shown himself powerless to give the theoretical insight into it which we possess. Here are two passages by Nerval which seem particularly significant in this regard: \n‘I will explain to you, my dear Dumas, the phenomenon of which you spoke earlier. There are, you know, certain story-tellers who cannot invent without identifying with their imaginary characters. You may recall how convincingly our old friend Nodier told us of his misfortune in being guillotined during the Revolution; we were so convinced by it, we asked him how he had managed to set his head back on his neck again.’ \n‘...And since you have been imprudent enough to have quoted one of the sonnets composed in this SUPERNATURALISTIC reverie, as the Germans say, you will have to hear them all. You will find them at the end of this volume. They are scarcely more obscure than Hegel’s metaphysics or Swedenborg’s MEMORABILIA (1766), and would lose their charm if explained, if the latter were possible, at least concede the value of the expression...’ (See also the term idéoréalisme in Saint-Pol-Roux) \n\nIt is dishonest in the extreme to dispute our right to employ the word SURREALISM in the quite specific sense that we understand it, since it is clear that before us the word lacked currency. I therefore define it once and for all: \nSURREALISM , n. m. Pure psychic automatism by means of which one intends to express, either verbally, or in writing, or in any other manner, the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, free of any aesthetic or moral concern. \nENCYCLOPEDIA . Philosophy. Surrealism is based on the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected association, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought. It tends to the destruction of all other psychic mechanisms completely, and to the replacement of them with itself, in solving the principal problems of life. The following have performed acts of ABSOLUTE SURREALISM , Messrs. Aragon, Baron, Boiffard, Breton, Carrive, Crevel, Delteil, Desnos, Éluard, Gérard, Limbour, Malkine, Morise, Naville, Noll, Péret, Picon, Soupault, Vitrac. \nThey appear, to date, to be the only ones, and there would be no question of error in this were it not for the fascinating case of Isidore Ducasse, about whom I lack data. And of course, a fair number of poets might pass for Surrealists, if one considers their works superficially, beginning with Dante, and in his finer moments, Shakespeare. In the course of various attempts at reducing to its basic principles, what by an abuse of confidence, is called genius, I have in the end found nothing that can be attributed to any other process. \n\nYoung’s Night Thoughts are surrealist from end to end; unfortunately a clergyman speaks, a bad clergyman, no doubt, but still a clergyman. \nSwift is surrealist in spitefulness. \nDe Sade is surrealist in sadism. \nChateaubriand is surrealist in exoticism. \nConstant is surrealist in politics. \nHugo is surrealist when he is not being stupid. \nDesbordes-Valmour is surrealist in love. \nBertrand is surrealist in the past. \nRabbe is surrealist in death. \nPoe is surrealist in adventure. \nBaudelaire is surrealist in morality. \nRimbaud is surrealist in his way of life, and elsewhere. \nMallarmé is surrealist in his confidences. \nJarry is surrealist in absinthe. \nNouveau is surrealist in the kiss. \nSaint-Pol-Roux is surrealist in symbolism. \nFargue is surrealist in atmosphere. \nVaché is surrealist within me. \nReverdy is surrealist at home. \nSaint-John Perse is surrealist at a distance. \nRoussel is surrealist in the anecdote. \nEtc. \n\nThey are not always surrealist, I would stress, In that, I discern in each of them a certain number of preconceived ideas to which – quite naively! – they clung. They clung to them because they failed to hear the surrealist voice, the one that continues to preach at the hour of death and above the storm, because they would not simply serve to orchestrate the marvellous score. They were instruments, too full of pride, and that is why they failed to produce harmonious sound at all times. (I might say the same of a number of philosophers and artists, including, among the latter, Ucello among the old masters, and in the modern era Seurat, Gustave Moreau, Matisse, in La Musique of 1939 for example, Braque, Duchamp, Picabia, Chirico, so admirable for so long, Klee, Man Ray, Max Ernst, and one very close to us, André Masson.) \nBut we, who are free from any attempt to filter, who in our works have made ourselves silent receptacles filled with echoes, modest recording instruments who are not hypnotised by the designs we trace, perhaps we serve a yet nobler cause. So we render with integrity the ‘talent’ lent to us. You may as well talk to me of the talent of that platinum ruler, that mirror that door, or the sky above. \nWe have no talent: ask Philippe Soupault: \n‘Anatomical products and cheap housing will destroy the greatest cities.’ \nAsk Roger Vitrac: \n‘No sooner had I summoned the marble-admiral than he pirouetted on his heels like a horse rearing at the pole star and showed me in the plane of his bicorn hat a region where I ought to spend my life.’ \nAsk Paul Éluard: \n‘It is an old tale I recount, a famous poem I re-read: I am leaning against a wall, with greening ears and scorched lips.’ \nAsk Max Morise: \n‘The cave-bear and his friend the bittern, the vol-au-vent and the wind his valet, the Lord Chancellor with his Lady, the scare-crow for sparrows and the sparrow his accomplice, the test-tube and his daughter the needle, the carnivore and his brother the carnival, the road-sweeper and his monocle, the Mississippi and its little dog, the coral and its jug of milk, the Miracle and its good Lord, have simply to disappear from the surface of the sea.’ \nAsk Joseph Delteil: \n‘Alas! I believe in the virtue of birds. And it only takes a feather for me to die laughing.’ \nAsk Louis Aragon: \n‘During a break in the party, while the players were gathering around a bowl of flaming punch, I asked the tree whether it still had its red ribbon.’ \nAnd ask me, who could not prevent myself writing the disturbing serpentine lines of this preface. \nAsk Robert Desnos, he who more than any of us, perhaps, is closest to the surrealist truth, he who, in his still unpublished works, NOUVELLES HÉBRIDES, DÉSORDRE FORMEL, DEUIL POUR DEUIL (New Hebrides 1922, illustrated by Miró 1974, Formal Disorder 1922/23, Grief for Grief 1924) and in the course of the numerous experiments he has lent himself to, has fully justified the hopes I placed in surrealism and leads me to hope for much more yet. Desnos now speaks surrealist at will. The prodigious agility with which he follows his thought orally is worth as much to us as the pleasure we derived from splendid speeches now lost, Desnos having better things to do than preserve them. He reads himself like an open book and does nothing to retain the pages, which fly off in the windy wake of his life.   \n\nSecrets of the Magical Surrealist Art \n\n- Written surrealist composition, or first and last draft \nHave writing materials brought, once you are settled in a place as favourable as possible for focusing the mind on itself. Put yourself in the most passive, or receptive, state you can. Forget about your genius, your talents, and those of others. Tell yourself repeatedly that literature is one of the saddest roads leading to everything. Write swiftly with no preconceived subject, swiftly enough that you cannot retain it, and are not tempted to re- read. The first sentence will arise spontaneously, it being the case in truth that each second there is a sentence, unknown to our conscious thought, which only asks to be externalised. It is quite difficult to make pronouncements about the next sentence; it no doubt participates in both our conscious activity and the other kind, if you agree that the fact of having written the first entails a minimum of perception. That should matter little to you, however; and in that resides, to a large extent, the interest of the surrealist game. It is still the case that punctuation definitely runs counter to the absolute continuity of flow which concerns us, although it may seem as necessary as the distribution of nodes on a vibrating string. Continue for as long as you wish. Trust in the inexhaustible nature of that murmuring. If silence threatens to establish itself, if you have committed an error: an error, let us say, of inattention, break off without hesitation with a more than obvious blank line. Following a word whose origin seems suspect to you, place some letter, the letter ‘l’ for example, the letter ‘l’ every time, and recall the arbitrary by making this letter the initial one of the very next word.  \n\n- How not to be bored in company \nThis is extremely difficult. Never be at home to anyone, and occasionally when some irrelevance has broken the injunction, interrupting you in the full flow of surrealist activity, your arms crossed, say: ‘It’s no matter, there are doubtless better things to do or not do. Life’s interests can’t sustain themselves. Simplicity, what’s going on within me is still tiresome!’ or some such revolting banality.  \n\n- How to make speeches \nPut your name on the list, on the eve of election, in the first country which considers it worthwhile proceeding with such public consultations. Each of us has the makings of an orator: the multicoloured loincloths, the glass baubles of words. Through surrealism one will surprise despair in all its poverty. One night on some public platform, all by oneself, one will carve up eternal heaven, that rich carcase. One will promise so much and perform so little that it will be a wonder. To the demands of an entire people one will concede a partial and ludicrous ballot. One will join together the most intractable of enemies in a secret yearning, which will blow nations apart. And one will achieve this merely by allowing oneself to be elevated by the vast word which melts with pity and spins with hatred. Incapable of failure, one will triumph among failures. One will be truly elect and the loveliest women will love one with all-consuming passion.  \n\n- How to write false novels \nWhoever you are, if your spirit moves you, burn a few laurel leaves, and without needing to fan the meagre flame, you’ll begin writing a novel. Surrealism permits it; you have only to position the needle marked ‘Fair’ at ‘Action’ and the game will begin. Here are some characters varying widely in appearance: their names in your writing can be simply capital letters, and they will conduct themselves as easily with respect to active verbs as does the personal pronoun ‘it’ towards words like: ‘rains’, ‘is’, ‘must’ etc. They will order them about, so to speak, and whenever observation, reflection and the power of generalisation prove of no assistance to you, be assured they will credit you with a thousand intentions you never had. Thus endowed with a small number of physical and moral characteristics, these beings, who in truth owe so little to you, will no longer depart from a fixed mode of conduct with which you no longer need to occupy yourself. A plot, appearing more or less skilful, will result from this, justifying point by point the moving or reassuring denouement about which you care not a jot. Your false novel will simulate a true novel to a marvellous degree; you will become rich and all will agree that you have ‘something in your belly’, since it is there as well that this something is located. Of course, by an analogous method, and provided you ignore what you review, you can devote yourself successfully to false criticism. \n\n- How to catch the eye of a woman you pass in the street .......................................................................................... .......................................................................................... .......................................................................................... ..............................................  \n\n- Against death \nSurrealism will introduce you to death which is a secret society.

Let my friends destroy every last copy of my Discourse on the Paucity of Reality. (Discours sur le Peu de Réalité 1927) Language has been given to Man so that he can make surrealist use of it. To the extent that he is required to make himself understood, he manages to express himself more or less, and by so doing to accomplish various functions from among those most vulgar. To speak, to read a letter presents little real difficulty to him, provided that, in so doing, he does not set a goal beyond the average, that is, provided he limits himself to conversing (for the pleasure of conversing) with someone. He is not worried about the forthcoming words, nor of the sentence beyond that which he utters. To a very simple question, he will be capable of giving a point-blank response. In the absence of tics contracted through dealings with others, he can pronounce spontaneously on a small number of subjects; he has no need to ‘think long and hard before speaking’ nor to formulate anything at all in advance. Who could convince him that this power of making a first draft will only do him a disservice if he chooses to establish more delicate relations? There is nothing about which he should refuse to speak, to write in abundance. To listen to oneself, to read oneself only has the effect of suspending the workings of the occult, that admirable resource. I am in no hurry to comprehend myself (Enough! I shall always comprehend myself). If such and such a sentence of mine causes me a momentary disappointment, I trust in the next sentence to right its wrongs, I refrain from beginning it over again or polishing it. Only the merest loss of impetus might prove fatal to me. Words, groups of words which succeed one another display the greatest solidarity among themselves. It is not for me to favour these at the expense of others. It is for a miraculous compensation mechanism to intervene – and intervene it does. Not only does this free flow of language which I seek to render forever valid, which seems to me to adapt itself to all the circumstances of life, not only does this language fail to deprive me of any of my resources, but it grants me further an extraordinary lucidity, and in the area I least expected. I shall even go so far as to state that it instructs me and, indeed, it has happened on occasions that I have employed surreally words whose meaning I have forgotten. I was able to verify subsequently that the way in which I had used them corresponded exactly to their definitions. That would lead one to believe that we do not ‘learn’, that we only ever ‘re- learn’. There are happy turns of phrase that I have thus become familiar with. And I say nothing of the poetic consciousness of objects I have been able to acquire through spiritual contact with them a thousand times repeated. However it is to dialogue that the forms of surrealist language are best adapted. Here, two thoughts confront one another; while one is being delivered, the other is occupied with it, but how is it so occupied? To suppose that it incorporates it within itself would be to admit that for a while it is possible for it to feed entirely on the other thought, which is highly improbable. And in fact the attention it pays is purely external; it only has time to accept or reject, generally reject, with all the consideration a man can summon. This mode of language moreover does not allow the depths of a subject to be plumbed. My attention, prey to a demand which it cannot with decency refuse, treats the opposing thought as an enemy; in ordinary conversation, it always almost ‘picks up’ on the words, the figures of speech employed; it places me in a good position to employ them in my reply while altering them. This is true to such a degree that in certain pathological mental states where sensory disorders occupy the patient’s whole attention, the latter, while continuing to reply to questions posed, will seize on the last word spoken in his presence, or the last fragment of some surrealist phrase a trace of which he finds in his mind: ‘How old are you? – You’ (Echolalia) ‘What is your name? – Forty-five houses.’ (Ganser syndrome, or a reply that is beside the point.) There is no conversation in which something of this disorder does not appear. The effort of socialising which dictates it and the considerable practice we have at it are the only things which allow us to conceal it temporarily. It is also the great weakness of a book that it is in a constant battle with its finest, by which I mean its most exacting, readers. In the short dialogue I improvised above, between doctor and madman, moreover, it is the latter who has the upper hand. Since, by his replies, he impresses27 but it grants me further an extraordinary lucidity, and in the area I least expected.

In the short dialogue I improvised above, between doctor and madman, moreover, it is the latter who has the upper hand. Since, by his replies, he impresses himself on the examining doctor’s attention – and because he is not the one who is asking the questions. Is that to say that at that moment his power of thought is stronger? Perhaps. He is free to take no more account of his age and name. Poetic surrealism, to which I am dedicating this study, has applied itself to date in re-establishing dialogue in accord with absolute truth, by freeing the two speakers from the obligations of polite behaviour. Each of them simply pursues his soliloquy, without trying to derive any particular dialectical pleasure and without imposing on his neighbour in any way. The statements made are not, as is usually the case, aimed at developing a thesis, however slight, they are as disinterested as possible. As for the reply they elicit, it is in principle totally indifferent to the self-esteem of the person speaking. The words, the images are only so many spring-boards for the mind of the listener. This is the way in which, in Magnetic Fields (Les Champs magnétiques,1919), the first purely surrealist work, the pages grouped together under the title Barriers (Barrières) should be construed, pages in which Soupault and I show ourselves as impartial interlocutors. Surrealism does not allow those who devote themselves to it to abandon it when they please. Everything suggests that it acts on the mind as drugs do; like them it creates a certain state of dependence and can drive Man to terrible acts of rebellion. It is also, if you like, an artificial paradise and the taste one acquires for it comes within the scope of Baudelaire’s criticism, under the same headings as drugs do. As does the analysis of the mysterious effects and special pleasures it can engender – in many respects surrealism presents itself as a new vice which it seems need not be restricted to only a few; like hashish it has the power to satisfy all tastes – place for such an analysis must necessarily be found in the present study. \n\n1. It is true of surrealist images as it is of those engendered by opium that Man does not evoke them, but that they ‘offer themselves to him, spontaneously, despotically. He cannot dispel them; for the will is powerless, and no longer governs the faculties.’ (Baudelaire) It remains to be seen whether images can ever be ‘evoked’. If, as I do, one accepts Reverdy’s definition, it does not seem possible to conjoin of one’s own volition what he terms ‘two distant realities’. The conjunction is made or not made, that is all. For my part, I refuse to believe, in the most formal; way, that in Reverdy’s work images such as: \nIn the stream there is a song that flows \nor: \nDay unfolded like a white tablecloth \nor: \nThe world returns to a sack \nreveal the slightest degree of premeditation. It is false, in my opinion, to pretend that ‘the mind has grasped the relationship’ between the two realities before it. Firstly, it has not grasped anything consciously. It is the juxtaposition of two terms, in some fortuitous manner, that has emitted a certain light, the light of the image, to which we show ourselves to be infinitely sensitive. The value of the image depends on the beauty of the spark obtained; it is, consequently, a function of the difference in potential between the two conductors. When a difference barely exists as in a comparison (note the image in the work of Jules Renard) no spark is produced. Now it is not in man’s power, to my mind, to effect the conjunction of two far distant realities. The principle of association of ideas, such as we conceive it, militates against it. Or else we would be forced to revert to an elliptical art, which Reverdy deplores as I do. We are obliged then to admit that the two terms of the image are not deduced one from another by the mind in order to conjure a spark, that they are simultaneous products of the activity I term surrealist reason limiting itself to noting and appreciating the luminous phenomenon. And just as the length of the spark increases to the extent it does when traversing rarefied gases, the surrealist atmosphere created by automatic writing, which I desire to place within reach of everyone, is especially conducive to the production of the most beautiful images. One might even say that, in this vertiginous race, the images appear, as the mind’s sole means of steering. The mind, little by little, becomes convinced of the supreme reality of these images. At first confining itself to submitting to them, it soon perceives that they stimulate its powers of reason, increasing its knowledge accordingly. It becomes conscious of limitless expanses where its desires are made manifest, where for and against are constantly diminished, where its obscurity does not betray it. It goes onward, borne by these images which delight it, which scarcely leave time to cool the fire in its fingers. It is the most beautiful night of all, the night of the lightning-flash: day, compared to it, is night. The innumerable types of surrealist image call for classification, a task which I do not propose to attempt here. To group them according to their specific affinities would take me too far afield; what I want to take account of, essentially, is their common virtue. The most powerful, for me, I must reveal, is that which presents the greatest degree of arbitrariness; that which takes the longest to translate into everyday language, either because it contains an immense amount of apparent contradiction; or because one of its terms is strangely hidden; or because proclaiming its sensational nature, it has the appearance of ending weakly (abruptly reducing the angle of its compass); or because it derives from itself a ridiculous formal justification; or because it is of a hallucinatory nature; or because it gives a mask of the concrete to the abstract in a very natural manner; or, conversely, because it implies the negation of some elementary physical property; or because it provokes laughter. Here, in order, are a few examples: \nThe ruby of Champagne. (Lautréamont) \nLovely as the law of arrested development of the breast in adults whose propensity to growth is not in proportion to the quantity of molecules the organism assimilates. (Lautréamont) \nA church stood there brilliant as a bell. (Philippe Soupault) \nIn Rrose Sélavy’s sleep a dwarf risen from a well comes to eat her bread at night. (Robert Desnos) \nOn the bridge the dew with a she-cat’s head rocks itself to sleep. (André Breton) \nA little to the left, in my divined firmament, I see – but it is doubtless only a mist of blood and murder – the frosted gleam of freedom’s disturbances. (Louis Aragon) \nIn the blazing forest, The lions were cool. (Roger Vitrac) \nThe colour of a woman’s stockings is not necessarily in the likeness of her eyes, which led a philosopher whom it is useless to name to declare: ‘Cephalopods have more reasons to hate progress than quadrupeds.’ (Max Morise) \nWhether we like it or not, there is enough there to satisfy several of the mind’s demands. All these images seem to testify that the mind is ripe30 time to cool the fire in its fingers. It is the most beautiful night of all, the night of the lightning-flash: day, compared to it, is night.

All these images seem to testify that the mind is ripe for something more than the benign joys it commonly accords itself. This is the only means it has to turn the ideal quantity of events it is charged with to its own advantage. (Let us not forget that, according to Novalis’ formula, ‘there is a series of events which runs parallel to real events. Men and circumstances commonly modify the ideal train of circumstances, so that it appears imperfect, and their consequences are equally imperfect. So it was with the Reformation; instead of Protestantism we got Lutheranism.’) These images show the mind the extent to which it usually dissipates itself and the disadvantages that it thus incurs. It’s no bad thing that the images ultimately disconcert it, since to disconcert the mind is to place it in the wrong. The sentences I cited provide amply for this. But the mind that savours them draws from them the conviction that it is on the right track; by itself, it is incapable of convicting itself of quibbling; it has nothing to fear anyway since it bids fair to encompass everything. \n\n2. The mind which plunges into surrealism relives with exaltation the best part of its childhood. For such a mind, it is a little like the conviction with which a person drowning reviews, in less than a moment, all the insuperable events of his life. You will say that is not very encouraging. But I have no intention of encouraging those who tell me so. From childhood memories and a few others emerges a feeling of being un- preoccupied and subsequently of being delinquent, which I regard as the most fecund that exists. It is childhood perhaps which comes closest to ‘real life’; childhood beyond which Man has, apart from his passport, only a few complimentary tickets at his disposal; childhood where everything nevertheless conspires to bring about his possession of himself, efficiently and without risk. Thanks to surrealism, it seems those opportunities return. It is as if one were still running towards one’s salvation, or perdition. One revisits, in the shadows, a precious terror. Thank God, it’s only Purgatory. We traverse, with a shudder, what the occultists call dangerous territory. I arouse the monsters lurking in my wake; they are not as yet ill-intentioned towards me, and I am not lost, since I fear them. Here are ‘the elephants with the heads of women and the lions flying’ that used to make Soupault and I tremble to encounter, here is ‘the soluble fish’ that still frightens me a good deal. SOLUBLE FISH, am I not the soluble fish, I was born under the sign of the Fish, and man is soluble in his thought! The fauna and flora of surrealism go un-avowed. \n\n3. I do not believe in the imminent establishment of a surrealist model. The common characteristics of all the texts of the genre, among them those I have just cited, and many others that might yield us a logical analysis and a strict grammatical analysis, do not preclude the specific evolution of surrealist prose in time. Following on from a number of essays I have offered in this vein over the past five years and which I am indulgent enough as to consider extremely disordered for the most part, the little stories which comprise the balance of this volume furnish me with glaring proof. I do not judge them, because of that, any more worthy or worthless, in demonstrating for the reader the benefits that the surrealist contribution is liable to effect in his consciousness. Surrealist methods moreover, demand to be elaborated. Everything is suitable for obtaining the immediacy desired from certain associations. The glued paper employed by Picasso and Braque has the same value as the introduction of a commonplace into a literary work of the purest style. It is even permitted to employ the title POEM for what we obtain from as gratuitous a collection as possible (observe, if you will, the syntax) of headlines and fragments of headlines snipped from newspapers: \nPOEM \nA burst of laughter \nOf sapphire in the island of Ceylon \nThe most beautiful straws \nHAVE A FADED COLOUR \nBENEATH THE BOLTS \nOn an isolated farm \nFROM DAY TO DAY \nworsens \nthe pleasant \nA driveable track \nleads you to the edge of the unknown \nthe café \npreaches for its saint \nTHE DAILY ARTISAN OF YOUR BEAUTY \nMADAME \na pair \nof silk stockings \nis not \nA leap in the void \nA STAG \nLove above all \nEverything could be arranged so well \nPARIS IS A LARGE VILLAGE \nWatch out for \nThe fire that covers \nTHE PRAYER \nOf fine weather \nKnow that \nthe ultra-violet rays \nhave finished their task \nShort and sweet \nTHE FIRST BLANK NEWSPAPER \nOF CHANCE \nRed will be \nThe wandering singer \nWHERE IS HE? \nin the memory \nin his house \nAT THE SUITOR’S BALL \nI do \nas I dance \nWhat one did, what one is going to do \n\nAnd one could offer many more examples.

Will the accused by acquitted, or will he merely be given the benefit of the doubt because of extenuating circumstances?

Will the accused by acquitted, or will he merely be given the benefit of the doubt because of extenuating circumstances? It is a pity that violation of the laws governing the Press is today barely acted against, for if that were not the case, we would soon see a trial of this kind: the accused has published a book which has outraged public decency. Several of his ‘highly respected and honourable’ fellow citizens have lodged a complaint against him, and he is also charged with libel and slander. There are also many other charges against him, such as insulting and defaming the army, inciting to murder, rape, etc. The accused, moreover, hastens to agree with his accusers in ‘stigmatizing’ most of the ideas expressed. His sole defence lies in claiming that he does not view himself as the author of the book, the said book being no more nor less than a surrealist concoction which precludes any question of merit or lack of it on the part of the person who signs it; further, that he has merely transcribed the document without offering any opinion on it, and that the text under accusation is at least as foreign to him as to the presiding judge. What is true for the publication of a book will also hold true for a whole host of other acts, as soon as surrealist methods begin to enjoy widespread favour. When that occurs, a new morality must be substituted for that prevailing, which is the source of all our trials and tribulations.) far more serious, and I have intimated it often enough, are the applications of surrealism to action. Certainly, I do not believe in the prophetic power of the surrealist word. ‘It is oracular what I say’ (Rimbaud: Une Saison en Enfer: Mauvais Sang): yes, just as you wish, but what is the nature of this oracle? (And yet, AND YET....We absolutely ought to get to the bottom of this. Today, June 8th, 1924, at one o’clock, the voice whispered to me: ‘Béthune, Béthune.’ What did that mean? I have never been to Béthune, and have only the foggiest notion where it is located on the map of France. Béthune evokes nothing for me, not even a scene from The Three Musketeers. I ought to have left for Béthune, where there was someone awaiting me perhaps; that would have been simply too obvious. Someone told me they once read in a book by Chesterton of a detective who, in order to find someone he is searching for in a certain city, merely scoured the houses, from roof to cellar, whose exteriors seemed abnormal to him in some way, if only in some slight detail. That method is as good as any other. Similarly, in 1919, Soupault entered any number of impossible buildings to ask the concierge whether Philippe Soupault lived there. He would not have been surprised, I suspect, by an affirmative. He would have gone and knocked on his door.) The piety of Man does not fool me. The surrealist voice that shook Cumae, Dodona and Delphi was nothing more than the voice which dictates to me my less irate speeches. My time ought not to be its time, why should it help me to resolve the childish problem of my destiny? I pretend, unfortunately, to act in a world where, in order to take account of its suggestions, I would be obliged to resort to two sorts of interpreter, one to translate its utterances for me, the other, impossible to find, to impress on others whatever understanding I had of those utterances. This world in which I endure what I endure (do not go and look), this modern world, well, what the devil do you want me to do with it? Perhaps the surrealist voice will fall silent, I no longer try to keep track of the vanished. I will not pursue, however briefly, the marvellously detailed account of my years and days. I will be like Nijinksi, who was taken last year to the Russian ballet, and could not comprehend what spectacle he was viewing. I will be alone, quite alone in myself, indifferent to all the world’s ballets. What I have done, or not done, I leave to you. And, since then, I have exhibited a passion for treating scientific reverie with indulgence, so unseemly in the final analysis in every respect. Radio? Fine. Syphilis? If you like. Photography? I don’t see why not. Cinema? Bravo, for darkened rooms. War? Gave us a good laugh. The telephone? Hello, yes. Youth? Charming white hairs. Try to make me say thank you: ‘Thank you.’ Thank you... If the populace hold in high esteem what properly speaking may be termed laboratory experiments, it is because they have led to the development of some machine, the discovery of some serum, in which the populace see themselves directly involved. They are certain that all this is designed to improve their lot. I don’t know what humanitarian aims are involved in the scientific ideal, but it does not seem to me that it constitutes any great kindness. I speak, you understand, of true scientists and not those of all kinds who popularise it by means of patents. I believe, in this domain as in any other, in the pure surrealist joy of the man who warned of the repeated failure of others, refuses to confess himself beaten, sets off from wherever he chooses, by any other road than a rational one, and arrives where he can. Such and such an image, with which he judges it opportune to mark his progress, and which perhaps may bring him public recognition, I must confess, is in itself a matter of indifference to me. No more does the material which he is obliged to encumber himself with: his glass tubes, or my metallic feathers...As to his method, I credit it with as much worth as my own. I have seen the discoverer of the cutaneous plantar reflex at work; he manipulated his subjects without respite, it was much more than an ‘examination’ he undertook, it was obvious that he followed no set plan. Here and there, he formulated a remark, distantly, without setting down his needle to do so; and while his hammer tapped away continuously. He left to others the futile task of treating the sick. He was devoted to his sacred fever. Surrealism, such as I envisage it, declares our absolute non- conformity clearly enough that there can be no question of bringing it before the court, at the trial of the real world, as a witness for the defence. It would, on the contrary, only serve to justify the utter state of absent- mindedness that we hope truly to achieve here below. Kant’s distraction with respect to woman, Pasteur’s distraction ‘with grapes’, Curie’s distraction regarding vehicles, are in this respect profoundly symptomatic. This world is only relatively-speaking in tune with thought, and incidents of this kind are only episodes, till now the most notable, in a war of independence in which I have the glory of participating. Surrealism is the ‘invisible ray’ which will one day allow us to gain the upper hand over our adversaries. ‘You no longer quiver, carcase.’ This summer the roses are blue; the wood is of glass. The earth draped in its verdure has as much effect on me as a ghost. It is living and ceasing to live which are imaginary solutions. Existence is elsewhere. "}]}

Wheels that have crossed long, dusty distances with their mineral and vegetable burdens, sacks from the coal bins, barrels, and baskets, handles and hafts for the carpenter's tool chest. From them flow the contacts of man with the earth, like a text for all troubled lyricists. The used surfaces of things, the wear that the hands give to things, the air, tragic at times, pathetic at others, of such things - all lend a curious attractiveness to the reality of the world that should not be underprized.\n\nIn them one sees the confused impurity of the human condition, the massing of things, the use and disuse of substances, footprints and fingerprints, the abiding presence of the human engulfing all artifacts, inside and out.\n\nLet that be the poetry we search for: worn with the hand's obligations, as by acids, steeped in sweat and in smoke, smelling of lilies and urine, spattered diversely by the trades that we live by, inside the law or beyond it.\n\nA poetry impure as the clothing we wear, or our bodies, soup-stained, soiled with our shameful behavior, our wrinkles and vigils and dreams, observations and prophecies, declarations of loathing and love, idylls and beasts, the shocks of encounter, political loyalties, denial and doubts, affirmations and taxes.\n\nThe holy canons of madrigals, the mandates of touch, smell, taste, sight, hearing, the passion for justice, sexual desire, the sea sounding-willfully rejecting and accepting nothing: the deep penetration of things in the transports of love, a consummate poetry soiled by the pigeon's claw, ice-marked and tooth-marked, bitten delicately with our sweatdrops and usage, perhaps. Till the instrument so restlessly played yields us the comfort of its surfaces, the woods show the knottiest suavities shaped by the pride of the tool. Blossom and water and wheat kernel share one precious consistency: the sumptuous appeal of the tactile.\n\nLet no one forget them. Melancholy, old mawkishness impure and unflawed, fruits of a fabulous species lost to the memory, cast away in a frenzy's abandonment-moonlight, the swan in the gathering darkness, all hackneyed endearments: surely that is the poet's concern, essential and absolute.\n\nThose who shun the ''bad taste'' of things will fall flat on the ice."}]}

Many wrote so. Childish nonsense: its activity extends today to the entire world and surrealism remains livelier, more audacious than ever. Andre Breton can look with pride upon the period between the wars and affirm that the mode of expression he created more than twenty years ago is opening upon an increasingly vast and immense ''beyond.''\nIf the whole world is struck by the influence of French poetry at a time when the most horrible disaster in its history swoops down upon France, it is, in part, because the great voice of Andre Breton was not stilled, and that is because everywhere, in NewYork, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Argentina, in Cuba, in Canada, in Algiers, voices echo that would not be what they are (in timber and resonance) without surrealism. Actually, today as twenty years ago, surrealism can claim the glory of being at the extreme point of the bow of life drawn to the breaking point.\nThe presence therefore of surrealism. Young, ardent, and revo-lutionary. Most certainly, in 1943, surrealism remains what it has always been, an activity which assigns itself the goal of exploring and expressing systematically the forbidden zones of the human mind, in order to neutralize them: an activity which desperately seeks to give humankind the means of reducing the ancient antinomies that are ''the true alembics of suffering''; a power, the only one, that allows us to reconnect with ''this original, unique faculty, that the primitive and the child still retain traces of, that lifts the spell of the impassable barrier between the inner world and the outer world.'' But as the surrealist cause in art, as in life, is the cause itself of freedom, the sign itself of vitality, surrealism has itself evolved. Evolution, better yet, a blossoming outward in all directions. When Breton created surrealism, the most urgent task was to free the mind from the shackles of absurd logic and so-called Western reason.\nBut when freedom found itself threatened throughout the world M 1943, surrealism, which never fora single instant ceased to stand in service to the greatest emancipation of humankind, wanted to SUM up the entirety of all its efforts in one magical word: freedom,\n\nIn art as in life, the surrealist cause is the cause itself of free-dom. Today more than ever, to draw one's inspiration abstractly from freedom, or to celebrate it in conventional terms, is to do it a disservice. In order to enlighten the world, freedom must make itself flesh and blood and, toward that end, must be reflected and recreated in language, in the word.\n\nThus speaks Breton. The demand for freedom, The necessity of absolute purity— it's the Saint-Just side of Breton, hence his ''Thank you, but no'' to concessions, harshly denounced by his friends more given to compromise.\n\nTo those who ask periodically why certain schisms have occurred at the center of the surrealist movement, why such abrupt exclusions have been pronounced, I believe I can reply in all clear conscience that those who eliminated themselves in the process had, in some more or less obvious way, broken a solemn pact with freedom, freedom being revered in its pure state by surrealists that is to say, advocated in all its forms there are, of course, many ways to have broken this pact. In my opinion, it was, for example, to have returned, as did some former surreal-ists, to fixed forms in poetry, when it has been demonstrated, particularly in the French language--the exceptional influence of French poetry since Romanticism allows me to generalize in this way—that the quality of lyric expression has benefitted from nothing so much as the will to be emancipated from obsolete rules: Rimbaud, Lautreamont mute things, the Mallarm6 of ''A Throw of the Dice,'' the most important symbolists (Maeter-linck, Saint-Pol-Roux), Apollinaire's ''conversation-poems.'' And this would be just as true for painting during the same period. In place of the:preceding names, it would suffice to cite those of Van Gogh, Seurat, Rousseau, Matisse, Picasso, Duchamp. It was also a betrayal, once and for all, of the freedom to renounce personal expression'' and in that way even dangerously always outside the strict frameworks to which a ''party'' wants to restrain you, even were it in your eyes the party of freedom (loss of the feeling of uniqueness). Freedom is at once madly desirable and quite fragile, which gives it the right to be jealous.\n\nThe intransigence consequently of freedom, which is, moreover, itself the condition of its fruitfulness. And we see that Breton, at the end of his most moving examinations, does not hesitate to ven-ture into the most wide-ranging virginal spaces that surrealism has yielded to human daring. What does Breton ask of the most insightful minds of the period? Nothing less than the courage to embark upon an adventure which may prove deadly, from all one can tell, but which one may hope—and that is the essence—will lead to the total conquest of the mind. ''A period, like the one we live in, can manage, if it has as a goal the arousal of mistrust for all the conventional ways of thinking the insufficiency of which is only too obvious, for travels a la Bergerac and Gulliver. And, not excluded from the voyage on which I invite you today, is every possibility of arriving somewhere, even after certain detours, to lands more reasonable than the one we leave behind.'' Surrealism is living, intensely, magnificently, having found and perfected a method of inquiry of immeasurable efficacy. The dynamism of surrealism. And it is this sense of movement that has kept it always in the avant-garde, in¬finitely sensitive to the disruptions of the period, the ''scourge of balance.''\nSuch is surrealist activity, a total activity, the only one that can liberate humankind by revealing to it the unconscious, one of the activities that will aid in liberating people by illuminating the blind myths that have led them to this point.\n\nAnd now, a return to ourselves.\nWe know where we stand in Martinique. The arrow of history dizzyingly indicated for us our human task: a society, corrupt from its origins through crime, reliant for the present on injustice and hypocrisy, fearful of its future because of its guilty conscience, must morally, historically, and inevitably disappear.\nFrom among the powerful war weaponry the modern world now places at our disposal, our audacity has chosen surrealism, which offers the greatest chances for success.\n.Already one result is established. At no moment during these difficult years of Vichy domination was the image of freedom ever totally extinguished here, and we owe this to surrealism. We are happy to have sustained this image in the eyes even of those who thought they had destroyed it forever. Blind because they were ignorant, they failed to see it laughing insolently, aggressively, in our pages. Cowards later, when they did understand, fearful and ashamed.\nSo, far from contradicting, diminishing, or diverting our revo-lutionary feeling for life, surrealism shored it up. It nourished in us an impatient strength, endlessly sustaining this massive army of negations.\nAnd then I think also to tomorrow.\n\nMillions of Black hands, across the raging clouds of world war, will spread terror everywhere. Roused from a long benumbing tor-por, this most deprived of all people will rise up, upon plains of ashes.\nOur surrealism will then supply them the leaven from their very depths. It will be time finally to transcend the sordid contemporary antinomies: Whites-Blacks, Europeans-Africans, civilized-savage: the powerful magic of the mahoulis will be recovered, drawn from the very wellsprings of life. Colonial idiocies will be purified by the welding arc's blue flame. The mettle of our metal, our cutting edge of steel, our unique communions —all will be recovered."}]}

The marvelous, sought for in the old clichés of the Forest of Broceliande, the Knights of the Round Table, Merlin the Magician, and the Arthurian cycle. The marvelous, pathetically evoked by the antics and deformities of sideshow characters--will the young poets of France never get tired of the freaks and clowns of the féte foraine, which Rimbaud dismissed long ago in his Alchemie du verbe?\nThe marvelous, manufactured by sleight of hand, by juxtaposing objects ordinarily never found together: the old, fraudulent story of the fortuitous encounter of the umbrella and the sewing machine on an operating table,which engendered ermine spoons snails in a rainy taxi, the lion's head on the widow's pelvis in Surrealist exhibitions. Or, even more to the point, the literary marvelous: the king in Sade's Juliette, Jarry's supermacho, Lewis's monk, the hair-raising theatrical props of the English gothic novel: ghosts, immured priests, lycanthropy, hands nailed to the castle door.\nThe result of attempting to arouse the marvelous at all costs is that the thaumaturges become bureaucrats. Invoked by means of cliched formulas that turn certain paintings into a monotonous mess of drooping clocks, seamstress' dummies, or vague phallic monuments, the marvelous is stuck in umbrellas, or lobsters, or sewing machines, or wherever, on an operating table, in a sad room, in a stony desert. Miguel de Unamuno said that memorizing rule books indicated a poverty of imagination. Today there are codes for the fantastic based on the principle of the donkey devoured by the fig ( proposed in the Chants de Maldoror as the supreme inversion of reality), codes to which we owe Children Menaced by Nightingales or Andre Masson's Horses Devouring Birds.\nBut we should note that when Andre Masson tried to draw the jungle of Martinique, with its incredible entangling of plants and the obscene promiscuity of certain fruits, the marvelous truth of the subject devoured the painter, leaving him virtually impotent before the empty canvas. It had to be an American painter, the Cuban Wifredo Lam, who showed us the magic of tropical vegetation, the uncontrolled creativity of our natural formations--with all their metamorphoses and symbioses--on monumental canvases whose expression is unique in contemporary art. Faced with the disconcerting poverty of imagination of a Tanguy, for example, who for twenty-five years now has been painting the same petrified larvae under the same gray sky, I feel compelled to recite the dictum that was the pride of the first generation of Surrealists: Vous qui ne voyez pas, pensez a ceux qui voient.[You who don't see, think about those who can.]\nThere are still too many ''adolescents who take pleasure in raping the freshly murdered cadavers of beautiful women'' (Lautreamont), who do not realize that it would be more marvelous to ravish them alive. It's that so many people forget, because it costs them so little to dress up as magicians, that the marvelous begins to be marvelous in an unequivocal way when it arises from an unexpected alteration of reality (a miracle), from a privileged revelation of reality, from an unusual insight that is singularly favored by the unexpected richness of reality, or from an amplification of the scale and categories of reality, perceived with particular intensity by means of an exaltation of the spirit that leads it to a kind of ''limit-state.''\nIn the first place, the phenomenon of the marvelous presupposes a faith. Those who do not believe in saints cannot be cured by the miracles of the saints, in the same way that those who are not Quixotes cannot enter, body and soul, into the world of Amadis of Gaul or Tirant lo Blanc. Certain remarks by Rutilio in Cervantes's Toils of Persiles and Sigismunda, about men being transformed into wolves, are prodigiously believable because in Cervantes's day it was believed that there were people afflicted with lupine mania. The same applies to the character's journey from Tuscany to Norway on a witch's cape. Marco Polo allowed that certain birds could fly carrying elephants in their talons; Martin Luther saw the Devil right before his eyes and threw an inkwell at his head. Victor Hugo, so exploited by the sellers of marvelous books, believed in apparitions, because he was sure of having spoken, while in Guernsey, with the ghost of Leopoldina.\nAll Van Gogh needed was faith in the Sunflower to capture its revelation on a canvas. Thus, the idea of the marvelous invoked in the context of disbelief--which is what the surrealists did for so many years--was never anything but a literary trick, and a boring one at that for having been prolonged, as is the literature that is oneiric by ''arrangement,'' or the praises of folly now back in fashion. But, by the same token, we are not, for all that, going to yield to those who advocate a return to the realism--a term that takes on, in this context, a slavishly political agenda--because they are merely replacing the magician's tricks with the commonplaces of academics or the scatological delights of some existentialists.\nThere is clearly no excuse for poets and artists who praise sadism without practising it, who admire the supermacho because of their own impotence, who invoke spirits without believing they answer to incantations, and who found secret societies, literary sects, or vaguely philosophic groups with passwords and arcane goals that are never achieved, without being able to conceive a valid mysticism or to abandon their pettiest habits in order to risk their souls on the frightening card of faith.\nAll of this became particularly evident to me during my stay in Haiti, where I found myself in daily contact with something we could call the marvelous real . I was treading earth where thousands of men, eager for liberty, believed in Mackandal's lycanthropic powers, to the point that their collective faith produced a miracle on the day of his execution. I already knew the prodigious story of Bouckman, the Jamaican initiate. I had been in the citadel of La Ferriere, a structure without architectonic precedents, portended only in Piranesi's Imaginary Prisons. I had breathed the atmosphere created by Henri Christophe, a monarch of incredible undertakings, much more surprising than all the cruel kings invented by the surrealists, who were very fond of imaginary tyrannies, never having suffered through one.\nI found the marvelous real with every step. But I also realized that the presence and vitality of the marvelous real was not a privilege unique to Haiti but the patrimony of all the Americas, where we have not yet established an inventory of our cosmogonies. The marvelous real is found at each step in the lives of the men who inscribed dates on the history of the Continent and who left behind names still borne by the living: from the seekers after the Fountain of Youth or the Golden City of Manoa to certain early rebels or modern heroes of our wars of independence, those of such mythological stature as Colonel Juana Azurduy.  It has always seemed significant to me that as recently as 1780 some perfectly sane Spaniards from Angostura set out in search of El Dorado, and that, during the French Revolution-- long live Reason and the Supreme Being!--Francisco Menendez, from Compostela, traversed Patagonia hunting for the Enchanted City of the Caesars. Looking at the matter in another way, we see that while in western Europe folk-dancing has lost all its magical evocative power, it is rare that a collective dance in the Americas does not embody a profound ritual meaning that creates around it an entire initiatory process: such are the santeria dances in Cuba or the prodigious African version of the Corpus feast, which may still be seen in the town of San Francisco de Yare in Venezuela.\nThere is a moment in the sixth song of Maldoror when the hero, chased by all the police in the world, escapes from ''an army of agents and spies'' by taking on the shape of diverse animals and making use of his ability to transport himself instantly to Peking, Madrid, or Saint Petersburg. This is ''marvelous literature'' at its peak. But in the Americas, where nothing like that has been written, there did exist a Mackandal who possessed the same powers because of the faith of his contemporaries and who used that magic to inspire one of the most dramatic and strange uprisings in History.\nMaldoror--Isidore Ducasse himself confesses it--was nothing more than a ''poetic Rocambole.'' All he left behind was a short-lived literary school. The American Mackandal, on the other hand, has left behind an entire mythology, accompanied by magical hymns, preserved by an entire people, who still sing them at Vaudou ceremonies. (There is, on the other hand, a strange coincidence in the fact that Isidore Ducasse, a man who had an exceptional instinct for the fantastic-poetic, was born in the Americas and bragged so emphatically at the end of one of his chapters of being ''Le Montevideen.'') Because of the virginity of its landscape, because of its development, because of its ontology, because of the Faustian presence of the Indian and of the Black, because of the Revelation its recent discovery constituted, because of the fertile racial mixtures it favoured, the Americas are far from having used up their wealth of mythologies.\nThe text that follows, even though I didn't conceive of it in programatic fashion, responds to this order of concerns. It tells of a sequence of extraordinary events that occurred on the island of Saint Dominigue over a period of time which does not exceed a singe human life. It allows the marvelous to flow freely from a reality set down strictly in all its details. The reader must be warned that the story he is going to read is based on rigorous documentation which not only respects the historical truth of the events, the names of the characters (even the minor ones), of the places, and even of the streets, but which also conceals under its apparently non-chronological facade a minute collation of dates and chronologies.\nAnd yet, because of the dramatic singularity of the events, because of the fantastic bearing of the characters who met, at a given moment, at the magical crossroads of Cap-Haitien, everything seems marvelous in a story it would have been impossible to set in Europe and which is as real, in any case, as any exemplary event yet set down for the edification of students in school texts. What, after all, is the history of all the Americas but a chronicle of the marvelous real? \n"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write me an Avant-Garde manifesto."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In English writing we seldom speak of tradition, though we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence. We cannot refer to “the tradition” or to “a tradition”; at most, we employ the adjective in saying that the poetry of So-and-so is “traditional” or even “too traditional.” Seldom, perhaps, does the word appear except in a phrase of censure. If otherwise, it is vaguely approbative, with the implication, as to the work approved, of some pleasing archaeological reconstruction. You can hardly make the word agreeable to English ears without this comfortable reference to the reassuring science of archaeology.\n\nCertainly the word is not likely to appear in our appreciations of living or dead writers. Every nation, every race, has not only its own creative, but its own critical turn of mind; and is even more oblivious of the shortcomings and limitations of its critical habits than of those of its creative genius. We know, or think we know, from the enormous mass of critical writing that has appeared in the French language the critical method or habit of the French; we only conclude (we are such unconscious people) that the French are “more critical” than we, and sometimes even plume ourselves a little with the fact, as if the French were the less spontaneous. Perhaps they are; but we might remind ourselves that criticism is as inevitable as breathing, and that we should be none the worse for articulating what passes in our minds when we read a book and feel an emotion about it, for criticizing our own minds in their work of criticism. One of the facts that might come to light in this process is our tendency to insist, when we praise a poet, upon those aspects of his work in which he least resembles anyone else. In these aspects or parts of his work we pretend to find what is individual, what is the peculiar essence of the man. We dwell with satisfaction upon the poet’s difference from his predecessors, especially his immediate predecessors; we endeavour to find something that can be isolated in order to be enjoyed. Whereas if we approach a poet without this prejudice we shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of his work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously. And I do not mean the impressionable period of adolescence, but the period of full maturity.\n\nYet if the only form of tradition, of handing down, consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes, “tradition” should positively be discouraged. We have seen many such simple currents soon lost in the sand; and novelty is better than repetition. Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to any one who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year; and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order. This historical sense, which is a sense of the timeless as well as of the temporal and of the timeless and of the temporal together, is what makes a writer traditional. And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity.\n\nNo poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not one sided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new. Whoever has approved this idea of order, of the form of European, of English literature will not find it preposterous that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past. And the poet who is aware of this will be aware of great difficulties and responsibilities.\n\nIn a peculiar sense he will be aware also that he must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past. I say judged, not amputated, by them; not judged to be as good as, or worse or better than, the dead; and certainly not judged by the canons of dead critics. It is a judgment, a comparison, in which two things are measured by each other. To conform merely would be for the new work not really to conform at all; it would not be new, and would therefore not be a work of art. And we do not quite say that the new is more valuable because it fits in; but its fitting in is a test of its value—a test, it is true, which can only be slowly and cautiously applied, for we are none of us infallible judges of conformity. We say: it appears to conform, and is perhaps individual, or it appears individual, and many conform; but we are hardly likely to find that it is one and not the other.\n\nTo proceed to a more intelligible exposition of the relation of the poet to the past: he can neither take the past as a lump, an indiscriminate bolus, nor can he form himself wholly on one or two private admirations, nor can he form himself wholly upon one preferred period. The first course is inadmissible, the second is an important experience of youth, and the third is a pleasant and highly desirable supplement. The poet must be very conscious of the main current, which does not at all flow invariably through the most distinguished reputations. He must be quite aware of the obvious fact that art never improves, but that the material of art is never quite the same. He must be aware that the mind of Europe—the mind of his own country—a mind which he learns in time to be much more important than his own private mind—is a mind which changes, and that this change is a development which abandons nothing en route, which does not superannuate either Shakespeare, or Homer, or the rock drawing of the Magdalenian draughtsmen. That this development, refinement perhaps, complication certainly, is not, from the point of view of the artist, any improvement. Perhaps not even an improvement from the point of view of the psychologist or not to the extent which we imagine; perhaps only in the end based upon a complication in economics and machinery. But the difference between the present and the past is that the conscious present is an awareness of the past in a way and to an extent which the past’s awareness of itself cannot show.\n\nSome one said: “The dead writers are remote from us because we know so much more than they did.” Precisely, and they are that which we know.\n\nI am alive to a usual objection to what is clearly part of my programme for the métier of poetry. The objection is that the doctrine requires a ridiculous amount of erudition (pedantry), a claim which can be rejected by appeal to the lives of poets in any pantheon. It will even be affirmed that much learning deadens or perverts poetic sensibility. While, however, we persist in believing that a poet ought to know as much as will not encroach upon his necessary receptivity and necessary laziness, it is not desirable to confine knowledge to whatever can be put into a useful shape for examinations, drawing-rooms, or the still more pretentious modes of publicity. Some can absorb knowledge, the more tardy must sweat for it. Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum. What is to be insisted upon is that the poet must develop or procure the consciousness of the past and that he should continue to develop this consciousness throughout his career.\n\nWhat happens is a continual surrender of himself as he is at the moment to something which is more valuable. The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality.\n\nThere remains to define this process of depersonalization and its relation to the sense of tradition. It is in this depersonalization that art may be said to approach the condition of science. I, therefore, invite you to consider, as a suggestive analogy, the action which takes place when a bit of finely filiated platinum is introduced into a chamber containing oxygen and sulphur dioxide.\n\nII\n\nHonest criticism and sensitive appreciation are directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry. If we attend to the confused cries of the newspaper critics and the susurrus of popular repetition that follows, we shall hear the names of poets in great numbers; if we seek not Blue-book knowledge but the enjoyment of poetry, and ask for a poem, we shall seldom find it. I have tried to point out the importance of the relation of the poem to other poems by other authors, and suggested the conception of poetry as a living whole of all the poetry that has ever been written. The other aspect of this Impersonal theory of poetry is the relation of the poem to its author. And I hinted, by an analogy, that the mind of the mature poet differs from that of the immature one not precisely in any valuation of “personality,” not being necessarily more interesting, or having “more to say,” but rather by being a more finely perfected medium in which special, or very varied, feelings are at liberty to enter into new combinations.\n\nThe analogy was that of the catalyst. When the two gases previously mentioned are mixed in the presence of a filament of platinum, they form sulphurous acid. This combination takes place only if the platinum is present; nevertheless the newly formed acid contains no trace of platinum, and the platinum itself is apparently unaffected; has remained inert, neutral, and unchanged. The mind of the poet is the shred of platinum. It may partly or exclusively operate upon the experience of the man himself; but, the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates; the more perfectly will the mind digest and transmute the passions which are its material.\n\nThe experience, you will notice, the elements which enter the presence of the transforming catalyst, are of two kinds: emotions and feelings. The effect of a work of art upon the person who enjoys it is an experience different in kind from any experience not of art. It may be formed out of one emotion, or may be a combination of several; and various feelings, inhering for the writer in particular words or phrases or images, may be added to compose the final result. Or great poetry may be made without the direct use of any emotion whatever: composed out of feelings solely. Canto XV of the Inferno (Brunetto Latini) is a working up of the emotion evident in the situation; but the effect, though single as that of any work of art, is obtained by considerable complexity of detail. The last quatrain gives an image, a feeling attaching to an image, which “came,” which did not develop simply out of what precedes, but which was probably in suspension in the poet’s mind until the proper combination arrived for it to add itself to. The poet’s mind is in fact a receptacle for seizing and storing up numberless feelings, phrases, images, which remain there until all the particles which can unite to form a new compound are present together.\n\nIf you compare several representative passages of the greatest poetry you see how great is the variety of types of combination, and also how completely any semi-ethical criterion of “sublimity” misses the mark. For it is not the “greatness,” the intensity, of the emotions, the components, but the intensity of the artistic process, the pressure, so to speak, under which the fusion takes place, that counts. The episode of Paolo and Francesca employs a definite emotion, but the intensity of the poetry is something quite different from whatever intensity in the supposed experience it may give the impression of. It is no more intense, furthermore, than Canto XXVI, the voyage of Ulysses, which has not the direct dependence upon an emotion. Great variety is possible in the process of transmutation of emotion: the murder of Agamemnon, or the agony of Othello, gives an artistic effect apparently closer to a possible original than the scenes from Dante. In the Agamemnon, the artistic emotion approximates to the emotion of an actual spectator; in Othello to the emotion of the protagonist himself. But the difference between art and the event is always absolute; the combination which is the murder of Agamemnon is probably as complex as that which is the voyage of Ulysses. In either case there has been a fusion of elements. The ode of Keats contains a number of feelings which have nothing particular to do with the nightingale, but which the nightingale, partly, perhaps, because of its attractive name, and partly because of its reputation, served to bring together.\n\nThe point of view which I am struggling to attack is perhaps related to the metaphysical theory of the substantial unity of the soul: for my meaning is, that the poet has, not a “personality” to express, but a particular medium, which is only a medium and not a personality, in which impressions and experiences combine in peculiar and unexpected ways. Impressions and experiences which are important for the man may take no place in the poetry, and those which become important in the poetry may play quite a negligible part in the man, the personality.\n\nI will quote a passage which is unfamiliar enough to be regarded with fresh attention in the light—or darkness—of these observations:\n\nAnd now methinks I could e’en chide myself\nFor doating on her beauty, though her death\nShall be revenged after no common action.\nDoes the silkworm expend her yellow labours\nFor thee? For thee does she undo herself?\nAre lordships sold to maintain ladyships\nFor the poor benefit of a bewildering minute?\nWhy does yon fellow falsify highways,\nAnd put his life between the judge’s lips,\nTo refine such a thing—keeps horse and men\nTo beat their valours for her? . . .\n\nIn this passage (as is evident if it is taken in its context) there is a combination of positive and negative emotions: an intensely strong attraction toward beauty and an equally intense fascination by the ugliness which is contrasted with it and which destroys it. This balance of contrasted emotion is in the dramatic situation to which the speech is pertinent, but that situation alone is inadequate to it. This is, so to speak, the structural emotion, provided by the drama. But the whole effect, the dominant tone, is due to the fact that a number of floating feelings, having an affinity to this emotion by no means superficially evident, have combined with it to give us a new art emotion.\n\nIt is not in his personal emotions, the emotions provoked by particular events in his life, that the poet is in any way remarkable or interesting. His particular emotions may be simple, or crude, or flat. The emotion in his poetry will be a very complex thing, but not with the complexity of the emotions of people who have very complex or unusual emotions in life. One error, in fact, of eccentricity in poetry is to seek for new human emotions to express; and in this search for novelty in the wrong place it discovers the perverse. The business of the poet is not to find new emotions, but to use the ordinary ones and, in working them up into poetry, to express feelings which are not in actual emotions at all. And emotions which he has never experienced will serve his turn as well as those familiar to him. Consequently, we must believe that “emotion recollected in tranquillity” is an inexact formula. For it is neither emotion, nor recollection, nor, without distortion of meaning, tranquillity. It is a concentration, and a new thing resulting from the concentration, of a very great number of experiences which to the practical and active person would not seem to be experiences at all; it is a concentration which does not happen consciously or of deliberation. These experiences are not “recollected,” and they finally unite in an atmosphere which is “tranquil” only in that it is a passive attending upon the event. Of course this is not quite the whole story. There is a great deal, in the writing of poetry, which must be conscious and deliberate. In fact, the bad poet is usually unconscious where he ought to be conscious, and conscious where he ought to be unconscious. Both errors tend to make him “personal.” Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.\n\n \n\nIII\n\nδ δε νους ισως Θειοτερον τι και απαθες εστιν\n\nThis essay proposes to halt at the frontier of metaphysics or mysticism, and confine itself to such practical conclusions as can be applied by the responsible person interested in poetry. To divert interest from the poet to the poetry is a laudable aim: for it would conduce to a juster estimation of actual poetry, good and bad. There are many people who appreciate the expression of sincere emotion in verse, and there is a smaller number of people who can appreciate technical excellence. But very few know when there is an expression of significant emotion, emotion which has its life in the poem and not in the history of the poet. The emotion of art is impersonal. And the poet cannot reach this impersonality without surrendering himself wholly to the work to be done. And he is not likely to know what is to be done unless he lives in what is not merely the present, but the present moment of the past, unless he is conscious, not of what is dead, but of what is already living."}]}
